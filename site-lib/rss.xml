One thing that fascinates me a lot is how different it is from other manufacturing methods. And how this, in turn, means a completely different design philosophy is needed to create good designs for 3d-printing.As such, I have been collecting the little tricks and rules for designing well-printable parts. And of course I am always on the hunt for more. In this blog post I want to share all that I have learned.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_md5.jpg" target="_self">While a lot can be found online about the basics of design for 3d-printing, there is not that much material that dives into it in-depth. And even less common are good overviews that collect all the little tricks that people have discovered.I believe the best format for teaching the rules of well-printable design is a format that is built on rules of thumb and many practical examples. While such heuristic rules will never encompass the whole complexity of the real world, I think they can provide a tangible guide towards the best solution in each situation. They also provide a starting point for building your own intuition about the topic.<br>This approach is close in spirit to the german book Konstruktionspraxis im Maschinenbau by Gerhard Hoenow and Thomas Meißner (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.hanser-kundencenter.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446464858" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.hanser-kundencenter.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446464858" target="_self">Hanser Fachbuch</a>, ISBN 978-3-446-46485-8). The book follows the same philosophy, but for traditional manufacturing methods. If you like this style, that book might interest you as well.<br>Before diving in, a few words about the scope of this blog post: First, I am explicitly focusing on FDM/FFF printing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>). A lot of the rules are specifically tied to the restrictions of this process and do not apply to other additive manufacturing methods.Second, I am focusing on designing functional parts with optimal mechanical properties. These parts should be easy to print, without requiring much printer fine-tuning. They should be easy to produce in higher quantity, which means they should require as little post-processing and waste as little material as possible. Aesthetics do not play a primary role, although I firmly believe that great mechanical design just looks incredibly beautiful :)Any mechanical design ultimately must be optimized for a large number of objectives and constraints. Your job as the designer is to create a part that fits best between them all.The most universal objectives are:
Design according to force — Parts should be designed such that their geometry is optimal for the forces it has to transmit and withstand.
Design according to manufacturing method — Often called DFM (Design For Manufacturing), parts should be designed such that they are easy to produce. Little changes, which usually don't affect functionality, can often make a part much simpler to manufacture.
Design according to cost — Parts should be as cheap as possible. With 3d-printing, this means minimizing material use and print time.
Of course, any real world project will have many more objectives and a lot of other constraints that the design must comply with.In this blog post, I will focus on topics related to design for manufacturing with a 3d-printer. In general, the rules for other objectives are the same, regardless of manufacturing process. However, there are some places where 3d-printing does influence these other objectives and I will also highlight such cases.An important distinction that I need to make at this point is how the approach of design engineering attacks the problem from the completely opposite side compared to, for example, slicer developers and 3d-printer manufacturers. While they aim for improving the manufacturing process itself, to better print any possible part geometry, a design engineer instead aims for adapting the part geometry to best work with the current state of the the manufacturing processes.To give an example, a design engineer aims to use the most coarse tolerance on each dimension that still allows the part to function. A 3d-printer manufacturer wants their machine to print with the most tight tolerance they can achieve. While the design engineer could try making use of this most tight tolerance, this will make the part impossible to manufacture using cheaper printers and thus drive up cost and limit possible suppliers for a part.This can be summarized as aiming for portable design. A portably designed part can be printed by anyone on any printer with ease. If you intend to share your designs online, this should definitely be a priority.Finally, it is also important to keep in mind that due to the rapid innovation in the 3d-printing scene, we are working with a moving target. As the 3d-printers and slicer software get improved, some of the design rules will become less important.To make sure everyone is on the same page, let's quickly review the most important terminology of FFF 3d-printing that will be used in the following chapters:
<br>Layers — The horizontal cross-sections of a part that are stacked on top of one another to create the part (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#layer-height" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#layer-height" target="_self">Layer height — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).
<br>Perimeters — On each layer, the 3d-printer will first print the outline of the cross-section. This outline consists of a number of perimeter lines (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#perimeters" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#perimeters" target="_self">Perimeters — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).
Shell — If you think of only the perimeters on each layer, you get a completely hollow object: The shell of the part.
<br>Infill — Inside the perimeters, the 3d-printer "fills" the space using a partially hollow pattern. This is the infill pattern (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" target="_self">Infill — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).
<br>Infill Percentage — How much of the infill pattern is solid vs. empty space (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" target="_self">Infill — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).
Overhang — When the cross-section of a layer gets larger than the previous layer, a part of the perimeter lines will not be supported by material from below. This is called an overhang and is actually possible as long as the overhang is not too large. Mostly, people talk about the angle of an overhang when looking at the layers from the side.
Bridges — While overhangs can become problematic, one thing 3d-printers are surprisingly good at is bridging gaps between two supporting surfaces. This is called a bridge.
<br>Seam — The seam is the point where the printer starts and stops laying a perimeter. This point is usually well visible as a perfectly smooth transition is very hard to achieve (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069" target="_self">Seam position — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>)
One final topic before we can dive in. To achieve the aforementioned portable designs, it is useful to define a design target for your work. Namely a rough outline of the 3d-printer and profile that the design will be printed with.While most of the following rules are relevant regardless, I will need to make some assumptions. Especially for all the numbers I will mention, a design target is needed for context. Otherwise values for expectable tolerances and empirical dimensional recommendations will have no meaning.As such, here is my definition of the standard printer profile. Cutting across the current market of 3d-printers, the vast majority are compatible with the following expectations. A lot of the expectations are intentionally kept quite vague — we must not assume too much, to keep the designs portable.
The standard 3d-printer is using an 0.4&nbsp;mm nozzle.
The standard profile prints at 0.2&nbsp;mm layer height.
The standard 3d-printer is calibrated such that no considerable dimensional deviation is caused by error in the steps/mm setting. Skew between the axes is negligible.
Print speeds are tuned to an adequate level but we cannot assume the printer to be free of artifacts like slight overshoot and ringing.
Bridging across reasonable distances is reliable.
Overhangs print fine.
Bed adhesion is adequate and does not pose an issue for non-extreme geometry.

<br>The first rules I will present are related to designing parts that are as strong as possible. In 3d-printing, the strength of a part is inherently tied to the manufacturing process. For one, the parts are partly hollow and thus behave quite differently than a solid block of plastic. Second, the layered manufacturing process leads to anisotropic parts — meaning their mechanical properties differ depending on direction (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy#Materials_science_and_engineering" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy#Materials_science_and_engineering" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).Thus, beyond general design rules for part strength, a few additional considerations should be made when designing parts for 3d-printing.Let's start with the most obvious: 3d-printed parts are much weaker in the direction of pulling apart the layers. Thus, before starting on a design, you should first consider the direction of tensile forces in your part and use them to decide on a print orientation. All further design should then be done with this print orientation in mind.<br>This is probably the number one rule that everyone talks about in design for 3d-printing. And that is for good reason because the difference it makes is substantial. Tests performed by My Tech Fun indicate roughly 3 times more strength in ideal orientation (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiQek0wei1g" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiQek0wei1g" target="_self">YouTube</a>). While the exact ratio will depend heavily on the individual part, I think this is a good indicator of how important this topic is.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_md5.png" target="_self">A threaded part designed for upright printing (not ideal for tensile loading) and one designed for printing flat on the bed. By cutting away a part of the thread, it can be printed lying flat on the print bed, without supports.You should also keep in mind that tensile forces are exerted to some cross section of a part when bending it. This means that you should also align any bending moments parallel to the print surface. A place where this often fails is printed clips, which bend slightly to clip into their counterpart. Such features will break easily when not oriented correctly.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_md5.png" target="_self">Clips like the one on the left do not survive many uses before breaking.<br>I also want to give a small tip here about sharing your designs on platforms like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/" target="_self">Printables</a>: Make sure you upload your models in the correct print orientation. While the correct orientation may seem obvious to you, others might not know and they will try printing your part without reorienting it first. You'll do them a small favor by uploading correctly oriented files 🙂Especially with complex parts, in some cases, no print orientation is ideal. While it is often fine to make a trade-off and accept limited strength in certain locations, one alternative should always be kept in mind:As each piece gets printed individually, you are completely free to choose the optimal orientation for each one. Clever joints can be used to easily assemble the whole part afterwards. Just to mention one: Dovetail joints have proven themselves for 3d-printing, as they are well-printable in most orientations.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_md5.png" target="_self">A dovetail joint is used to attach two halves of a part so that each piece can be printed in an improved orientation.Contrary to the first rule, a topic that is not talked about enough in my eyes is the role of infill in part strength. There is a big misconception that you can magically give your part ultimate strength by just using 100% infill. While you will certainly see an increase in strength, this method is not efficient at all — most of the additional material does not contribute to part strength and is just waste and an unnecessary increase of print time.Why? It all has to do with the distribution of force inside of a part. Generally, most parts are not stressed in pure tension or compression. Instead, a lot of stress is applied in the form of bending moments and those distribute the force unevenly. The force will be greatest in places furthest away from the center (neutral axis). Thus, it is generally more effective for additional material to be added at the surface, not the center of a part.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_md5.png" target="_self">Stress is highest directly beneath the surface of the part. Notice the blue neutral axis in the middle, where stress is lowest.<br>In 3d-printer speak, this means you should increase the number of perimeters/shells rather than the infill percentage. Stefan from CNC Kitchen has done a thorough analysis of this (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmEaNAwFSfI" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmEaNAwFSfI" target="_self">YouTube</a>).<br>In general, his work is a great resource for in-depth information about the mechanical behavior of 3d-printed parts (CNC Kitchen <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnckitchen.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/" target="_self">Blog/Website</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen" target="_self">YouTube</a>).<br>However, there is more to this. We can actually influence the amount of stress at the surface by changing the shape of the part. This is often much more effective than optimizing print settings. A way to conceptualize the stress inside of a part is to think about the forces "flowing" through it. The visual representation of this is called a force lines drawing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_lines" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_lines" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_md5.png" target="_self">Force lines in a plate with a central crack under tension.<br>Kokcharov, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" target="_self">CC BY 3.0</a>, via <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CrackForceLines.png" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CrackForceLines.png" target="_self">Wikimedia Commons</a>Stress will concentrate in places where the force lines are close together. You can see how the sharp corners of the crack in the image above lead to regions of particularly high stress and thus will probably lead to part failure in these locations.This isn't specific to 3d-printing but as it is such an important topic, I want to include it here anyway. The rules are generally the same for any manufacturing method: We want to minimize stress and the best way to do it is this:Or in other words, keep the force lines as short and straight as possible.One example where this matters a lot are sharp corners. They impact part strength very negatively and are usually easy to avoid by simply adding a fillet. You can see how a fillet allows a much more direct path for the force than a sharp corner:<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_MD5.svg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_md5.svg" target="_self">Force lines around a sharp corner vs. a corner with a fillet.The inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printed parts with their shell and infill has yet more implications for part strength that are worth talking about. In traditional design engineering, you are taught to reduce cross-sectional area of a part as much as possible. You should only keep material in places where it has the highest effect on increasing part strength. The reason for this is that reduced volume directly leads to reduced material usage and thus cost and weight savings.With 3d-printing, things work differently. You can usually increase the cross-sectional area quite a bit, without a noticeable increase in material usage, as the infill is mostly empty space. You should rather strive to reduce the surface area of a part, because that is where most material is used.This means that you can get away with much thicker shapes in 3d-printed parts, which obviously benefits part strength a lot. Don't try to work against this artificially — if a design allows for it, go for the fattest shape possible.<br>To give an example, think about the traditional I-beam (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>) cross-section. The idea is that material is only kept in the regions far away from the neutral axis of the bending moment, where it has the highest impact on part strength. This allows for significant weight savings.While the I-beam profile works wonders for homogeneous materials, it is not a good idea for 3d-printing. A square cross-section of the same outer dimensions will have comparable or better strength but usually does not lead to an increase in material usage and print-time. It might actually perform better in those areas, as shown below.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_md5.png" target="_self">Comparison of print times and material usage for I-beam profile and square profile.In traditional mechanical engineering, whenever a part needs to be evaluated for its strength, the tool of choice is simulation. Simulation allows making accurate prediction of a part's behavior under load without needing to manufacture it. Especially for parts made from expensive materials or made using expensive manufacturing methods, performing simulations beforehand is critical for the project's budget.Unfortunately, simulation quickly breaks down when trying to analyze 3d-printed parts. The problem is, once again, the inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printing. While stress analysis may still be useful to find critical areas to give attention to, extracting realistic values for limiting forces is a lost cause.Luckily, there is an alternative to simulations that 3d-printing offers. The exceptionally low cost of manufacturing 3d-printed parts means that printing prototypes for testing mechanical properties is often the most cost-effective solution. Need to find yield strength of a design? Just print a few copies and empirically determine it.However, there is one things to be careful with: While I see test-prints as a great way to determine mechanical properties, I advise to not rely on them for determining dimensional accuracy. I will go into more detail on my reasons for this in the next chapter.<br>Finally, an implication of the above is that topology optimization (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>) is not really well suited for FFF 3d-printing. While it is amazing for other additive manufacturing processes, current tools are usually not able to produce designs that would truly be optimal for FFF 3d-printing. Not to speak of the often less-than-ideal printability of such parts.Next, I want to talk about optimizing your design to improve manufacturing tolerances. Certain shapes will generally print cleaner than others. If you take this into consideration during design, you can achieve parts that fit on first print and won't need endless tweaking of the slicer settings and printer. A welcome side-effect of improved tolerance is a cleaner part finish as well. Thus, the following chapter covers both: Manufacturing tolerance and part finish.To start, let's talk about edges. Generally, mechanical parts should avoid sharp edges because they are unpleasant to touch. Any good design breaks edges by either adding a round fillet or a 45° chamfer of appropriate size.While the choice between the two is often made for stylistic reasons, there are actually some rather important printability aspects to it. There are two situations that we have to look at, distinguished by the print orientation of the edge:Adding a fillet or chamfer to edges parallel to the print surface means the feature will be built up from multiple layers, potentially with overhang. Fillets are not well suited for this. They start with an incredibly steep overhang that will not print well. Often, such fillets will have large surface deviations. Even if no overhang is involved, when the fillet sits on top, the changing curvature will make the layer steps very visible, degrading the part finish. Chamfers are much better suited in this orientation. They have a constant overhang angle, leading to a very consistent layer stepping, which looks a lot more pleasing.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_md5.png" target="_self">Fillets and chamfers on edges parallel to the print surface. The blue perimeter on the bottom of the fillet marks an unsupported overhang.Contrary, edges vertical to the print surface are much better suited for fillets. A fillet means that the printer does not have to make sharp corners while laying the perimeters. This reduces print-head acceleration and thus reduces surface artifacts (ringing, overshoot). A chamfer on such edges will have two sharp corners, which will never look as pretty and will never achieve the same tolerances as a round fillet.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" target="_self">Fillets and chamfers on edges vertical to the print surface. The print speed significantly decreases for the chamfer corners while the fillets can almost keep the same velocity.Thus, unless stylistic choices dictate something else, the cleanest prints will be achieved by following this rule:With horizontal fillets, a major problem is the steep overhang. There are other design features where similar problems arise. For example, horizontally oriented circular holes. The larger they get, the bigger the problem will be. The solution is to deviate from the perfect circle for a more optimized shape. For smaller holes, a teardrop shape with a 90° angle works well. Larger holes can be extended to have a flat "roof". Keep in mind that a slight amount of additional clearance will be needed beneath the roof, due to the bridges drooping slightly.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_md5.png" target="_self">On the left: A ⌀4&nbsp;mm hole with a 90° teardrop. On the right: A ⌀10&nbsp;mm hole with a flat roof. The roof sits 0.4&nbsp;mm above the theoretical circle so slight drooping of the bridge won't affect the fit.A topic that is very important for both part finish and dimensional tolerances is the placement of the perimeter seams. Perimeter seams are the point where a perimeter line starts and ends. It is very hard to tune a printer such that there won't be any seam artifacts. Thus, let's put thought into the placement of this seam so it does not interfere with any functionality or aesthetics.Usually, the seam placement is chosen automatically by the slicer. For each layer, it searches for the sharpest corner (concave or convex) and then places the seam right into it. This has proven to be a very reliable way to produce good results without requiring any explicit user input.However, this algorithm breaks down in two situations:
On perfectly round perimeters, like those of a circular hole or outline.
When all corners have the same angle or when the sharpest corner requires tight tolerances.
Especially the first case is very relevant. This effect has severe consequences for the tolerances you can achieve with a circular hole. While the rest of the perimeter may deviate by less than 0.1&nbsp;mm, the seam artifacts can easily bump that up to 0.4&nbsp;mm. And worse, it shifts the centerline of the hole because the seam is only in one place.The solution is simple: Add a corner where the seam can be placed without interfering. Instead of a perfect circle, shape the hole like a teardrop where the corner has a 120° angle. Note the difference to the horizontal holes discussed previously.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_md5.png" target="_self">This teardrop shape allows the seam to not interfere with the circular hole (white dots/line indicates seam placement).Similarly, if other corners must not be used for seam placement, add a small notch somewhere that will serve as the "sharpest corner" and thus take the seam automatically. While you can of course also manually place the seam using the slicer software, this trick means no slicer tweaking is needed.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_md5.jpg" target="_self">Difference of forcing the seam placement. On the left, the seam destroys the appearance of the groove in the center. On the right, a small notch on the back of the part takes the seam and the groove looks much better.To summarize:A fundamental building block of any "design for manufacturing" is knowing the accuracy limits of the manufacturing process. As stated in the beginning, the goal is to build portable designs, so we should assume conservative limits instead of exhausting the capabilities of a particular printer. Note that this is backwards to the traditional workflow: Instead of specifying tolerances that someone else then has to achieve during manufacturing, you accept certain tolerances of the manufacturing process and design accordingly.It also needs to be noted that a base assumption here is that the 3d-printers in question are well-calibrated. A machine that is out of calibration will have an additional constant error on top of its tolerances. For example, badly configured steps/mm values will lead to a constant factor deviation of measurements along a certain axis. Part design cannot and should not accommodate for this — there wouldn't be much left if we tried.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_md5.png" target="_self">A miscalibrated printer will have a constant error on top of its general manufacturing tolerances.Before we can talk about tolerance values, it is important to understand what causes these deviations in the first place. A tolerance value means nothing without the context that it applies to. In 3d-printing especially, tolerances will vary widely depending on specific part geometry. This topic is quite far-reaching, as a very large number of factors play into it. As such, this chapter will only contain the most important things to consider.Starting from the bottom, the lower bound on accuracy is due to the step resolution of the printer's stepper motors and their drivers. Fundamentally, there is no way to get more accurate than this, as dimensions will always fall somewhere between two step locations. However, on state-of-the-art 3d-printers, the theoretical step resolution is around 0.01&nbsp;mm. Whether this value is actually achievable is debatable, but the takeaway is that step resolution is well below the deviations caused by other effects.Continuing on, there are more effects of the printer's motion system on dimensional accuracy. They all have to do with mechanical unrigidness of the printer. Tuning the slicer settings and advanced motion control (input shaping) can bring large improvements here. However, an equally big role is played by the geometry the print-head is printing. Sharp corners are the worst offender as they force the printer to maximum acceleration. By optimizing a part for "easy motion", tolerances of printed parts can often be improved a lot.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" target="_self">Once again, fillets and chamfers show quite spectacularly how different the print-head acceleration will be in different scenarios. Sharper corners lead to higher acceleration and will thus have worse tolerance.The next anti-accuracy component of a 3d-printer is the extruder and hotend. Uneven extrusion makes the line width vary, which has an impact on the outer dimensions of a part. Additionally, the nozzle of the printer always slightly drags the extruded line behind it. This leads to circles always being slightly undersized. On inner circles (vertical holes), assume deviation to make the hole smaller. On outer circles, assume deviation to make the outer diameter smaller, but to a lesser degree.As a rule of thumb, for current popular FFF 3d-printers with an 0.4&nbsp;mm nozzle at 0.2&nbsp;mm layer height, these effects lead to deviations in the range of ±0.1&nbsp;mm for each surface. The deviations are shifted for circular paths, as mentioned. While many surfaces will be more accurate, this value is a safe bet for surface deviation.Unfortunately, while 3d-printers usually do not have a noteworthy growth in tolerance for larger dimensions, other effects take over here: Especially warping and shrinkage of the 3d-printed parts as they cool down.Warping and shrinkage depend heavily on the choice of material, but there are also part geometries that experience it more than others. In general, the more voluminous a part is and the less sharp its edges are, the less warping can be expected. Think about the forces exerted when the material shrinks and how the geometry can resist those forces.<br>The previous chapter discussed what tolerances can be expected from the FFF 3d-printing process. However, there are of course situations where more accuracy is required. One approach that is often used to deal with this is experimentally determining a CAD dimension where the final part fits perfectly. 3d-printing makes this very easy because test prints are cheap and fast. Often, 3d-printers have surprisingly good repeatability so a dimension that was optimized using test prints can achieve quite incredible tolerances. Some call this the goldilocks approach (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/finding-perfect-part-fits-with-the-goldilocks-approach-and-openscad/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/finding-perfect-part-fits-with-the-goldilocks-approach-and-openscad/" target="_self">Hackaday</a>).However, this empirical approach has a huge drawback: It makes your design depend heavily on the slicer settings that were used and the specific printer that the part was printed on. As discussed in the beginning, the goal is to avoid such dependence as it makes the design less portable.Luckily, there are other approaches that you can use to achieve the same goal, but without requiring tight tolerances. Of course, these approaches also have their limitations. So what is best in a given situation needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.The first approach I want to discuss here is ingeniously simple. It is best summarized like this (and I wish I had a proper source for this quote):The idea is that in places where accuracy is needed, you should design your part such that the dimension can be adjusted. There is a huge variety of adjustment mechanisms to choose from. The following four examples should serve to demonstrate the possibilities:Oblong holes for screws allow sliding a part into alignment. This allows for a large range of motion, but makes adjustments of less than 1&nbsp;mm very difficult. This method can also be used quite well to correct for angular errors.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/8c0c330469eaacd96ba641edc93e9ebb_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/8c0c330469eaacd96ba641edc93e9ebb_md5.jpg" target="_self">An oblong hole is used to allow adjusting the position of a part.Opposing screws for height adjustment allow fixing a dimension in place quite permanently. The natural reduction of the screws make tiny adjustments easy to perform. A downside is that access from both sides is needed, which is not always easily achievable. Adjusting such a mechanism is unfortunately a bit tedious, because it is a constant back and forth between loosening one screw a bit and then tightening the opposing screw again.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f8e1c38b0b60249e54af551f31d95e66_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f8e1c38b0b60249e54af551f31d95e66_md5.png" target="_self">The two screws in the center oppose each other to finely adjust the height of the block between them.(Grub)screws opposed by a spring or flexure are great for making adjustments very easy. The spring tension counteracting the screw means that turning the screw either direction adjusts the dimension accordingly. If required, a second (grub)screw can be used to fix the part in place after adjusting.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/da1a9d2dc19b4175aec8d39f0c76b33e_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/da1a9d2dc19b4175aec8d39f0c76b33e_md5.jpg" target="_self">A height adjustment using a long M5 screw opposed by a spring.Shimming with spring steel shims is the industry favorite for small adjustments that only need to be changed very seldomly. Premade shims in various thicknesses are stacked to achieve the precise offset that is required. Industrial shims are usually made from spring steel, but 3d-printed shims may be conceivable for some applications. However, especially for rather small heights, small surface defects from the printing process could negatively affect accuracy.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/a08c0d6daf98edfa44912cd38639e7b0_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/a08c0d6daf98edfa44912cd38639e7b0_md5.jpg" target="_self">Crude example of a small 0.2&nbsp;mm shim being used for levelling a fixture.In traditional mechanical engineering, when two parts need to fit each other geometrically, a so-called engineering fit is used. An engineering fit is a systematic classification of the allowed dimensions for the two parts. Usually, this system of fits is applied to holes and shafts, but it can be applied to other shapes equally well.The most important distinction is between
clearance fits where there is always some play between the parts, for any of the allowed dimensions,
transition fits where they might be play or interference,
and interference fits where the two parts will always interfere and thus (significant) force is required to join them. This is also referred to as a press fit.

These are great for traditional manufacturing, but unfortunately, they are mostly useless for 3d-printing. We can't really print parts to a specific tolerance — instead, the 3d-printer has an inherent tolerance that we have to design for.<br>If tight tolerance engineering fits are required regardless, an option that should not go unmentioned is post-processing of printed parts. Especially for printed holes, there is the possibility of reaming (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>) them, to achieve, for example, an H6 fit. That said, this option only makes sense where absolutely required. Otherwise, the additional effort is hard to justify.For any other cases, the choice is essentially between a clearance fit and an interference fit. Clearance fits are easy — a gap between the parts that is larger than 2x the printer tolerance does the trick. Interference fits, on the other hand, are more difficult. The problem is that large print tolerances mean the forces in the interference fit vary wildly between different parts. In the worst case, this can even lead to joints breaking due to excessive forces.To counteract this, designs need to tolerate the large tolerances of 3d-printing. There are a few tricks one can use here, which I will share next.The seemingly obvious solution for transition- or interference-fitting a circular shape is a circular hole in your design. However, I want to make the point that this is rarely the best solution for 3d-printing. Especially when the aforementioned tolerance issues become relevant, circular holes should be avoided.Other shapes, like squares or hexagons can fit the mating part just as well but are much more forgiving in regards to tolerance. The reason for this can be seen when considering how each shape deforms in interference situations. A circle can only widen by stretching along its circumference. This quickly leads to material failure when large amounts of interference need to be compensated. A square or hexagon, on the other hand, can bend to accommodate the bigger diameter. Little to no stretching of the material is present in this case.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00da7542e4ccd693615942a94e8df7ba_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00da7542e4ccd693615942a94e8df7ba_md5.png" target="_self">red: oversized shaft / green: undersized circle or hexagon / grey hatching: interference regionsA circle has to stretch significantly while a hexagon just bends a little bit.Another point in favor or the square or hexagon is the seam problem, as discussed before. A perfect circle will be heavily distorted by the seam while a square can hide the seam neatly in one of its corners.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0ea3281b2a5663c04289da35a46ec939_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0ea3281b2a5663c04289da35a46ec939_md5.png" target="_self">Hexagonal holes are used for a light press-fit with cylindrical stubs. This design also has two pockets to the sides of each stub that help with easy removal.This technique is mostly useful for smaller diameters. The additional space occupied by the corners can become problematic for lager holes and as such, different design approaches should be preferred.For bigger diameters, there is another trick that can be borrowed from injection molding. Crush ribs are features that are meant to be plastically deformed during assembly. Usually, a ribbing structure is added to a hole where the ribs can be crushed into the "valleys" between them.<br>In injection molding, these crush ribs are mainly used to work around the required draft angle. For 3d-printing, we can repurpose them to compensate the printer tolerance, as described by Dan Royer (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://hackaday.com/2020/10/15/adding-crush-ribs-to-3d-printed-parts-for-a-better-press-fit/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://hackaday.com/2020/10/15/adding-crush-ribs-to-3d-printed-parts-for-a-better-press-fit/" target="_self">Hackaday</a>).<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/74f93e5ddf7be082d1db7b6c30734c55_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/74f93e5ddf7be082d1db7b6c30734c55_md5.png" target="_self">A blind bore with crush-ribs designed for a press-fit with a shaft.The ribs are dimensioned such that they still achieve the required interference at either end of the tolerance band. Because deforming the small ribs is much easier than deforming an entire contact surface, the joining force is kept within limits across the entire tolerance band.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/10d8b2b9101dc25340f45798a1871184_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/10d8b2b9101dc25340f45798a1871184_md5.png" target="_self">To achieve a secure fit, the force of the minimum and maximum press-fit must be considered.When designing crush ribs, keep in mind that such small features are prone to have much worse tolerance than larger features. This has two effects:
The tolerance of the crush rib shown in the drawing above will be larger than usual.
As the crush-rib is a convex shape, it is likely to be more undersized than oversized.
To give some numbers, undersizing the crush ribs by 0.2&nbsp;mm and oversizing the bore by 0.4&nbsp;mm lead to good results for me.Something to keep in mind with crush ribs is that they should not be reassembled more than once. Their reliance on plastic deformation means that the joint force will significantly decrease on reassembly.<br>Another interesting approach presented by Slant 3D is called grip fins (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzg_NXM-NRs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzg_NXM-NRs" target="_self">YouTube</a>). Instead of plastic deformation, like with crush ribs, grip fins only deform elastically. The big advantage is of course, that such a joint can be reassembled repeatedly, which crush ribs do not really allow for.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/886eee6a47bf82b468b4e2cc7b88406a_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/886eee6a47bf82b468b4e2cc7b88406a_md5.png" target="_self">Grip fins are an approach for tolerance compensation that use elastic deformation.We have talked about designing for strength and designing for accuracy. Let's move closer to the manufacturing process itself. The following chapter will investigate ways to improve parts such that 3d-printing them gets easier, faster, and to make parts less likely to result in failed prints.The elephant in the room is certainly the topic of support material. Support material is used as scaffolding for features of a part that would otherwise hang in thin air. After printing, it is removed, to reveal the final shape.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/ab017d2254ed6573f44c9d70dce221a4_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/ab017d2254ed6573f44c9d70dce221a4_md5.png" target="_self">Support material (shown in green) is used to help print an overhang that would not be possible otherwise.Unfortunately, the use of support material comes with a number of drawbacks:
It adds an additional post-processing step after printing. The removal of supports can be quite time-consuming.
It consumes additional material, which later turns to waste.
It leads to bad tolerances on supported surfaces, much worse than for the rest of the part.
It leaves a worse surface finish on supported surfaces.
For the designer, the implication is simple:Yes, there are certainly many situations where using supports is the appropriate choice. But more often than not, slight design changes can eliminate features that would otherwise require supports.“_resources/design-for-3d-printing/10eb7ecc16a7d9cc6cd77321bteacher7bd4_MD5.png” could not be found.Example of a feature that can be optimized to not require support material.A big role in this is played by the overall orientation of a part on the print bed. This was discussed previously, for part strength considerations, but has equal effect on support requirement. Balancing between these two is often quite tricky.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/c71262afea3fc27c05508dc9943597c4_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/c71262afea3fc27c05508dc9943597c4_md5.png" target="_self">The dilemma of optimizing for part strength or for avoiding supports: The orientation of the hook on the left part needs no supports but the force on the hook can rip the layers apart. The orientation on the right is ideal for strength but needs support material.In this case, the left option was chosen anyway because the forces are small enough to not break the layers.One design trick that is surprisingly powerful is the exploitation of diagonal orientation. Rather than keeping the rectangular shapes of a part aligned to the printer axes, tilt the part upwards by 45°.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/97f6d623e5c38d9327337e0a6d5637ad_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/97f6d623e5c38d9327337e0a6d5637ad_md5.png" target="_self">The left orientation leads to a large bridge which will leave inaccuracy and visible artifacts. Simply tilting the part so all the straight edges get printed diagonally leads to all sides getting printed equally well.Not only does this method avoid supports or overly long bridges, it also leads to a more uniform part finish as all faces now get printed with the same orientation. The easily discernible top and bottom surfaces are elegantly avoided.<br>Of course print stability is affected by this. You may need to include a brim to keep such parts from falling over. Slant 3D explores this concept of diagonal orientation in more depth (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TIhkxQNINY" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TIhkxQNINY" target="_self">YouTube</a>).Even with the best intentions, it is not always possible to make a part work without requiring any support material. While this may mean that it is time to accept defeat and just print using supports, there is one last option that should be evaluated. It certainly isn't always the way to go, but it is worth considering:The trade-off here is between accepting the downsides of support material or making assembly more complex. Both solutions will require some amount of post-print work, but which solution is better will always depend on the exact circumstances. Especially for one-off or low-volume designs, a slightly more complex assembly is easy to justify.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f736e21d6b3ae5e6bef615ca4dcdbdbb_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f736e21d6b3ae5e6bef615ca4dcdbdbb_md5.jpg" target="_self">The hooks were printed separately and then attached using screws. This allowed avoiding supports and also helped with optimizing print orientation for better surface finish in critical locations (for example, the taper of the hook).A large number of situations where avoiding supports gets tricky are caused by the need for printing counterbored holes upside-down.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/42b4470161eff61d0940be27e3343f55_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/42b4470161eff61d0940be27e3343f55_md5.png" target="_self">An upside-down counterbore is problematic to print due to unsupported overhangs.Taking a cross-section, the problem is easily visible: The step of the counterbore is unsupported. Bridges won't work, because the hole in the middle gets in the way. Using support material to help would be particularly nasty here, because removing it from inside the hole can be very difficult.One solution for this problem is the use of a sacrificial layer. The idea is simple: Instead of an unsupported overhang, a bridge across the entire hole is created. This bridge is only a single layer high and only serves to support the smaller diameter hole on top.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/36b7faf1e31579794490d2ac2e812cb1_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/36b7faf1e31579794490d2ac2e812cb1_md5.png" target="_self">A one layer thick bridge was added to the upside-down counterbore.

The next step is to cut it out using a knife or to remove it with a drill.Of course, upside-down counterbores aren't the only place where this trick can be useful. In fact, the next chapter will show an even better solution for upside-down counterbores. But to give an example, I have often used sacrificial layers for the counterbore equivalent of an oblong hole.Sacrificial layers are a useful tool, but they come with an additional post-processing step. There can also be problems with strands from the bridging becoming loose while cutting out the sacrificial layer. Lucky for us, there is an even more clever way to deal with overhanging counterbores in particular.Instead of bridging over the entire hole and thus closing the through-hole on top, bridges are only placed where they don't interfere. Layer by layer, more bridges are added to finally achieve the circular inner hole.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d9e6d8967ef15b1504b34fe0cca234c7_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d9e6d8967ef15b1504b34fe0cca234c7_md5.png" target="_self">The layers of this design are as follows, from the bottom up:
First, simply cut the circular counterbore to the desired depth.
Then, make a one layer thick cut (typically 0.2&nbsp;mm) such that only material remains where the bridges do not run across the inner hole. Two strips of bridges will be left, running left and right of the inner hole.
On the next layer, make another one layer thick square cut with the side length matching the inner hole diameter. This will only leave bridges running top and bottom of the inner hole, perpendicular to the bridges on the layer before.
Finally, from the next layer on, the inner hole will be printed as a circle. This works because the remaining bridges are small enough to not cause issues.

You can see the bridges crossing perpendicularly.This trick is particularly elegant because it does not require any post-processing and it prints exceptionally cleanly. Of course, there is a limit to this, mostly with increasing diameters. But unless there is a good reason against it, this method should be your go-to for any overhanging counterbores.For transparency, I tried finding an original source for this, but unfortunately it isn't clear who first came up with it...The concept from the overhanging counterbores can be generalized to an even more powerful method. The basic idea of bridges that support further bridges can be used for quite advanced geometry that does not need any supports. You will also see this called sequential bridging in some places.<br>An impressive example is the OpenFlexure microscope (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/" target="_self">Website</a>), where this design approach is used extensively.

This gives the lower bridge more strength and more time to cool before it gets loaded with the features on top.We have previously evaluated the I-beam shape in the context of 3d-printing. The conclusion was that simply shaving off volume is a traditional design approach that does not map well to 3d-printing. There are more cases where this topic pops up. Cutouts, that are meant to save material, are commonly added, while really not achieving their purpose in 3d-printed designs. In fact, they can lead to the opposite: More material usage and longer print times.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/2a5a922d9d851d9fba3bb50d7b44e32d_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/2a5a922d9d851d9fba3bb50d7b44e32d_md5.png" target="_self">A real world example of a part where holes were added with the intent of saving material. But after comparing the models it gets clear that the holes actually increased the material usage and print time.It is necessary to shift the focus from volume to surface area, as that is where material is most dense in 3d-printed parts. You should strive to reduce surface area by making shapes fat and voluminous.Finally, a topic that mostly becomes relevant when many parts are to be printed. To optimize the removal of the final part from the print surface, certain considerations can be made.<br>First of all, the surface area that is touching the bed should be carefully balanced. Too little will lead to parts toppling over during printing. Too much will make detaching the part more difficult. Slant 3D has some nice tips about this (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwXREFoWKA" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwXREFoWKA" target="_self">YouTube</a>).<br>Related, if you are using brims to counteract parts coming loose, the mouse ear approach presented by Slant 3D (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCcFMDv_4eo" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCcFMDv_4eo" target="_self">YouTube</a>) is a portable alternative to consider that also reduces post-processing effort.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/730c17ec0f9a664ef48b9205bdcf9a59_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/730c17ec0f9a664ef48b9205bdcf9a59_md5.png" target="_self">Two types of mouse ears: The right one is placed directly on the part. The left one has a small stub which makes removal even easier.Mouse ears are directly designed into the CAD shape of the part so they do not need to be added later during slicing.Functional integration is the art of designing such that each part performs as many of the required functions as possible. The goal is to reduce part count. This speeds up assembly and thus often leads to decreased manufacturing cost.A ubiquitous example of functional integration are clips in injection molded plastic parts. They replace the additional joining element that would be required otherwise. For this reason, they play a large role in making products cheaper and easier to manufacture. Clips will be discussed in more detail later.3d-printing is suited especially well for functional integration, because additional geometric complexity does not really impact manufacturing cost. This is in contrast to, for example, subtractive machining, where additional geometric features generally drive up the cost. So striving for maximum functional integration is usually a good idea with 3d-printing.However, there are some nuances to this. Printing everything in a single part limits the print orientation for some features. This can negatively affect strength, tolerances, and geometric freedom. Additionally, a highly integrated part is more difficult to prototype because each iteration requires reprinting a large model. And later in the life cycle, repair of a broken part also requires replacement of a bigger component than what would have been necessary with a design of many smaller parts that are joined together. More than once, I have explicitly kept certain functions in separated parts to facilitate easier prototyping or repair.Nevertheless, the following chapters will demonstrate some design ideas that allow integration of certain features.<br>The first idea that I will demonstrate is a rather simple trick. You can add small channels to surfaces of your part that allow fastening a zip tie to fix some cables or wires in place. There is a great video by Alan Reiner where I learned about this (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgt9P6jsyaY" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgt9P6jsyaY" target="_self">YouTube</a>). The Zip Tie City demo model is available for download (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/248291-zip-tie-city" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/248291-zip-tie-city" target="_self">Printables</a>).<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/a08a498abf7369bc673ad26552d13d6c_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/a08a498abf7369bc673ad26552d13d6c_md5.jpg" target="_self">Zip tie channels are used to fix cables to a moving assembly. You can spot one unused zip tie channel to the left.The channel design is quite simply a section of a hollow cylinder. Dimensions that work well for smaller zip ties (100&nbsp;mm) can be taken from the drawing below.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/6fe61d6bec98cb8deed31f65aa124775_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/6fe61d6bec98cb8deed31f65aa124775_md5.png" target="_self">Zip tie channel dimensions for typical 100&nbsp;mm zip ties.An important note is that orientation of the zip tie channels should be considered. When the channel is printed such that no perimeters bridge across it, it gets much weaker. In this orientation, the bridge can easily get ripped out which I have already seen happening in practice.<br>Usually, mechanical parts are designed such that they can be considered completely stiff in approximation. Flexures are design features that explicitly use elasticity of a part to integrate certain freedoms of movement (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).Overall, 3d-printing is perfect for designs that incorporate flexures. The thin features required by flexures are easy to print, while complex to create with other manufacturing methods.Two types of flexures that are very common will be discussed in more detail below: Clips and so-called "living hinges". But first, a few general points about flexures in 3d-printing are presented.The amount of movement allowed by a flexure is mostly limited by how much deflection is possible without plastic deformation. A thicker flexure will start plastically deforming much earlier. Thus, it is very important to keep flexures as thin as possible when large movements are intended. Force can be increased by stacking multiple thin flexures, rather than creating a single thick one. Alternatively, the travel distance of a thicker flexure can be increased by increasing its length — maybe even in a snaking pattern.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_md5.jpg" target="_self">The hooks on this cable comb are made from two parallel flexures. This is more stiff than a single flexure, but has the same travel in the elastic region.To make flexures long-lived, it is important to ensure they cannot be moved too far. Features should be strategically placed as end-stops to a flexures movement. This way, the movement is always kept in the elastic region and the flexure will live much longer.<br>Another use for flexures is sidestepping tolerance issues. This only works when no significant force is exerted on the joint, but can be a nice tool to cheaply solve accuracy issues. An example of this are the previously discussed <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#grip-fins" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#grip-fins" target="_self">"grip fins"</a>.Arguably the largest amount of flexures show up in the form of clips. Clips have revolutionized the mass-production industry because they provide a fastener-free way of joining together parts. Either permanently or in a way that can be repeatedly opened and closed again. For the same reason, clips are popular for 3d-printed designs — avoiding additional fastening hardware is often desirable.However, care must exercised with design of clips. The travel distance of the clip, retention force, and feature size must be carefully balanced. Another significant factor is the orientation of the clip relative to the print surface. Especially clips built across layers are very fragile. In many cases it is better to keep travel minimal and instead work with a larger clip force for retention.For clips that retain by form-locking the other part geometrically, it is a great idea to include a way to undo the clip. Usually, this can be achieved by providing space to reach the clip with a tool like a screw-driver to push it backwards.One more type of flexure that has exploded in popularity as part of optimizing for mass-production are "living hinges". These are hinges which move by plastic deformation rather than disjoint parts rotating on an axis. Any cheap plastic container with a lid probably uses one or two of these hinges, because they are so much more cost-effective and simple than proper hinged joints.We can also make use of living hinges in 3d-printed design, but there are a few limitations: The hinge absolutely needs to to lie flat on the print bed to achieve the thin sheet of plastic that reliably deforms. Experiments have been done with living hinges made from bridging layers, but these do not perform nearly as good.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a30dfaa80b166e7dfc835932b7d9e36_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a30dfaa80b166e7dfc835932b7d9e36_md5.png" target="_self"><br>Example of a box with a large living hinge by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/124607-1-piece-box-with-living-hinge" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/124607-1-piece-box-with-living-hinge" target="_self">@3DMakerNoob</a>.<br>Engineers Grow has discussed living hinges for 3d-printing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2CqXgaQsyI" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2CqXgaQsyI" target="_self">YouTube</a>) and so has Slant 3D (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiEyFle6lTM" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiEyFle6lTM" target="_self">YouTube</a>).Another design element that's sometimes suited for integration are bearings. Especially where large diameter bearings are required, it can be more effective to integrate the bearing into the design of the mating parts instead of using an off-the-shelf component.To integrate a bearing, the races become features of the part design. During assembly, standard steel bearing balls are inserted. Optionally, a printed cage may be necessary to ensure correct spacing between the balls.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/e2f0fe4c0915d95534b67e842e131f7f_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/e2f0fe4c0915d95534b67e842e131f7f_md5.jpg" target="_self"><br>Example of a 3d-printed bearing by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@Positive_Altitude" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Positive_Altitude" target="_self">Positive Altitude</a>.<br>Positive Altitude has published a video where printed bearing design is discussed in a lot more detail (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/0KhV6JW2sHg" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/0KhV6JW2sHg" target="_self">YouTube</a>).As the final type of functional integration that will be discussed, print-in-place mechanisms are another unique possibility of 3d-printing. Multiple parts of an interlocking mechanism can be printed at the same time. No post-print assembly is required.Print-in-place mechanisms can include joints that would be impossible to assemble after printing. The trick is that interlocking parts are printed in their already joined position. This can be an incredibly useful design tool to make strong mechanisms without complicated assembly.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/5393536059d01c24ae2bf6d5562c5ac0_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/5393536059d01c24ae2bf6d5562c5ac0_md5.jpg" target="_self">Standard example of a print-in-place mechanism is the herringbone planetary gear set.

Part orientation is fixed, making avoiding supports and design for strength difficult to achieve. Especially where interlocking parts meet, it can be difficult to adequately support floating geometry. Sometimes, special break-away surfaces are placed between parts. These then have to be broken with force after printing.Another critical topic for print-in-place design is the necessary clearance between interfacing parts. Printing multiple surfaces very close to each other can be difficult for some printers. It seems that a clearance of 0.3&nbsp;mm should allow most current printers to print a design.After discussing the peculiarities of 3d-printed parts for so long, it is time to widen the horizon. Most functional designs will not be entirely 3d-printed, but also include other components. The largest number of them are most likely going to be machine elements. Screws, nuts, bearings, and all the other standard parts optimized for certain functions. In the following chapter, design considerations related to the use of such machine elements will be evaluated.Arguably the most ubiquitous machine elements are screws. For the most part, they are used to fasten different components to each other. While it is easy to just pick the next best screw and design your parts around it, there is more to it if the joint is meant to last. In traditional mechanical design, selection of screws can be a science of itself. Especially, when the screw is heavily loaded or safety critical. With design for 3d-printing, it is technically no different — but fortunately, you can usually get away with ignoring a lot of the complexity involved. Nonetheless, I think it is important to at least know the limits and some general guidance on what is good or bad for a screwed connection of 3d-printed parts.<br>In screw theory, one of the most important values is the preload force (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint#Theory" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint#Theory" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>). That's the clamping force exerted by the screw at rest after tightening. For a screwed joint to work, the preload force must be greater than any forces experienced by the joint during operation.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_md5.jpg" target="_self">A bolted or screwed joint can be modelled using springs. Preload compresses the parts and elongates the screw. As long as the external load never becomes greater than the preload, the joint is fixed in place.<br>Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg" target="_self">Stephen Mckelvey</a>.In metal to metal joints, this preload is achieved by elongation of the screw. In 3d-printing and other thermoplastics applications, the joint members are much less stiff than the screw, leading to the preload mostly coming from compression of the plastic parts instead. The implication is that any of the traditional preload calculation methods are mostly useless here.Attempting to reach the required preload force, one quickly reaches the yield strength limit of the printed parts, leading to deformation or worse. While the achievable preload is usually enough to deal with static loads of an application, it is often not possible to counteract the dynamic loads. Vibrations or shocks are usually the worst offenders.The solution is one that's also often used for additional security of metal joints as well: Use additional screw locking measures, like lock-nuts or a threadlocking adhesive.Another noteworthy parameter of screwed joints is the length of the screw, or more precisely the length of the compressed section of the 3d-printed parts. As a rule of thumb, you should design the joint such that the screw is as long as possible.There are two effects at play that make this a reasonable choice:
A long screw ensures the part is preloaded entirely in compression rather than tension. When an external load is then applied, it counteracts the compression. With a short screw, the external load would just add more tension which printed parts often cannot take well anyway.
A longer screw has to be tightened with more turns to compress the part past its yield strength. This means it becomes less likely to accidentally overtighten the joint.
With screws and thermoplastics, an important consideration is the thread for the screw to fasten to. In metal applications, the thread is often simply cut into the mating part. With 3d-printed parts, the same is possible, but threads made from thermoplastics are a lot weaker. This means the threads can be easily stripped by overtightening the screw.Nonetheless, plastic threads are an option. They can be tapped into a part if an adequately sized hole is printed and wall thickness is high enough. For bigger diameter threads (M8 and up), modelling the threads in CAD and printing them is an option, although quality of such threads is not always good. The strength of thermoplastic threads is surprisingly good — however they do not like repeated assembly and the aforementioned overtightening problem should not be underestimated.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_md5.jpg" target="_self">Tapping a thread into a printed part.<br>An alternative to thread tapping is to combine the previously discussed concept of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" target="_self">Crush Ribs</a> with a standard threaded screw.

The rib threads start tapered to make it easy to get the screw in.As the downsides of plastic threads are well known from injection molding, alternative solutions have emerged. Most popular are small metal threaded inserts which are added to the part as a strong and long-lasting thread. Usually, these inserts are heat-set into an appropriately dimensioned hole.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/318accc5381abdb3fea7ae75ac7af63b_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/318accc5381abdb3fea7ae75ac7af63b_md5.jpg" target="_self">M5 heat-set threaded inserts in a 3d-printed part.Threaded inserts are much stronger than plastic threads. They are not easily stripped by overtightening and they survive repeated reassembly many times over.<br>Such threaded inserts have become very popular in the 3d-printing community. Stefan from CNC Kitchen has a nice writeup about the use of heat-set inserts (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/tipps-amp-tricks-fr-gewindeeinstze-im-3d-druck-3awey" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/tipps-amp-tricks-fr-gewindeeinstze-im-3d-druck-3awey" target="_self">CNC Kitchen</a>).A design limitation of threaded inserts is that they are not reliably usable for screws inserted from the back side. During insertion, heat-set inserts often push some molten plastic into the hole beneath them, preventing easy insertion of a screw from the back side. While the hole diameter can be tuned to prevent this, my experience is that this is not really portable to other 3d-printers.A more cost effective alternative to threaded insert is embedding standard nuts into 3d-printed parts. Usually, this is done by preparing an appropriate cutout into which the nut can be inserted after or during printing.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/070750eee40643054abc68942a928239_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/070750eee40643054abc68942a928239_md5.jpg" target="_self">A standard M4 nut embedded into a part. It was inserted through the sideface cutout visible in the picture.Embedded nuts are not only cheap, they are also a great alternative for the mentioned design limitation of threaded inserts. A nut is predestined to be placed on the far side of a part, making through-joints with long screws easy to realize. This also plays into the benefits of using long screws again.Two kinds of cutouts have emerged in my designs:
Sideface cutouts are rectangular cutouts reaching in from a side of the part to insert the nut horizontally.
Backface cutouts are hexagonal pockets on the exit of the screw through-hole.

On the left, the cutouts are from the side. On the right, the they are from the back of the screw.The big downside of the embedded nuts approach is that they often fall out of their cutouts during assembly. Tuning the cutout dimensions usually does not work well — the only real solution is to "plug" the cutouts by inserting the nuts halfway through the print. This does, however, complicate the printing and assembly complexity considerably, so it often is not a desirable choice either.With all these options for adding threads and the many design considerations surrounding them, one last factor that does play a role is the strength of the threads. Lucky for us, all of the discussed options almost always have strength beyond the design requirements, with the other factors being more prevalent.<br>Again, Stefan from CNC Kitchen has a nice writeup on his experiments on the topic (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/helicoils-threaded-insets-and-embedded-nuts-in-3d-prints-strength-amp-strength-assessment" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/helicoils-threaded-insets-and-embedded-nuts-in-3d-prints-strength-amp-strength-assessment" target="_self">CNC Kitchen</a>).Let's look at machine elements beyond screws next. While the use of dowel pins is quite rare in 3d-printed design, they should still get mentioned. In traditional mechanical design, they are the go-to solution for accurately and repeatedly locating one part to another.<br>As the tolerances of 3d-printing often make such accuracy superfluous, the uses of dowel pins here are limited. Additionally, such pins need an engineering fit which is difficult to achieve in 3d-printing. The best solution are the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#circles-considered-harmful" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#circles-considered-harmful" target="_self">hexagonal holes</a> or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" target="_self">crush ribs</a> mentioned before, or post processing of the printed parts.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f027d24b5738bd7f9e53ce4157be5b51_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f027d24b5738bd7f9e53ce4157be5b51_md5.png" target="_self">A fixture for precisely aligning a part for laser engraving.

This concept can be used for many other things as well — many designs have been published that use this method in some way.To quickly discuss the concept again, it works like this:
In the design, a cavity is left for the component to occupy.
During slicing, a pause is configured right before the layer above the cavity.
When the printer reaches the pause, the hardware is inserted.
Then the print is resumed, enclosing the hardware and often permanently fusing the part with it.
<br>To get some inspiration, take a look at the window in this <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/894202-modern-gridfinity-case" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/894202-modern-gridfinity-case" target="_self">Modern Gridfinity Case</a> by Matthew. It is made from a transparent PETG sheet that gets inserted into the print. The design even includes small tabs to hold the sheet in place, right as it is inserted. This makes for a very robust design and the result is hard to achieve with any other methods.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/e3a3db3d95883df9721cb839f1032427_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/e3a3db3d95883df9721cb839f1032427_md5.jpg" target="_self"><br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9dfaf5bac59b38082c1735b932873d80_MD5.gif" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9dfaf5bac59b38082c1735b932873d80_md5.gif" target="_self">Of course, many other components can be inserted into 3d-prints. To name a few more:
"Trapped fasteners" are inserted such that they cannot fall out of the part, making it hard to loose them.
Magnets
Metal mesh
Of course the big advantage of embedded hardware is that additional joining or fastening means can be avoided. Do, however, consider the downside that embedded hardware can only be extracted destructively and replacement is usually impossible.A technique that is very similar to inserted hardware, but deserves attention on its own, is incorporating fabric into a 3d-print. This produces parts with unique flexibility, especially interesting for wearable applications. For this reason, 3d-printing onto fabric is quite popular in the cosplay scene.The gist is that a print consisting of many individual pieces is paused roughly 2 to 3 layers in. Then a piece of tulle fabric is draped across the initial layers. When resuming the print, the new layers on top will fuse into the lower ones, securing each part to the fabric.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_md5.jpg" target="_self">Showcase of some cosplay parts printed onto fabric.<br>Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@UncleJessy" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@UncleJessy" target="_self">Uncle Jessy</a>.<br>The flexibility of the resulting design can be finely controlled by the geometry of the solid 3d-printed shapes. Other people have already experimented with this technique a lot, for example you can check out the video tutorial from UncleJessy (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjH5KGw3Psw" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjH5KGw3Psw" target="_self">YouTube</a>).While appearance isn't the main concern of functional design, no parts should be designed without consideration of their appearance. 3d-printing uniquely allows complex surface shapes to be added "for free". Suddenly, the consideration is no longer about increased manufacturing cost, the only remaining factor is the time it takes to design such shapes.Of course, complex shapes should still follow the basic constraints of the process — avoiding overhangs and not mandating support material. But beyond that, there is no reason to limit designs to the straight and rectangular shapes of traditional functional parts.There are even places where complex, maybe organic, shapes have a use beyond appearance: For ergonomic design, such shapes are usually much better suited.One trick we can borrow from traditional product design practices are shadow lines. They improve the appearance of seams between mating surfaces of multiple joined parts. When two surfaces are pressed directly against each other, the result will never look great due to the imperfections on both sides leading to an uneven seam.Shadow lines improve on this by leaving a controlled larger gap between the surfaces and hiding the actual mechanical connection behind a small lip. The larger gap is wide enough such that the small surface imperfections are no longer distinguishable. This leaves the result with a very even look without requiring extreme precision.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_md5.jpg" target="_self">The upper and lower half of the valve actuator body have an evenly sized gap between them. The real seam is actually hidden behind the shadow line.It may be enough to place a single lip on the shadow line to hide the real seam. If dust protection is of concern, a second lip on the inner side can transform the shadow line into a sort of labyrinth seal, providing for more than just aesthetics.Shadow lines can also be used on parts joined at an angle, like a lid placed flat onto a box. In this case, a constant offset is left between the size of the lid and the surrounding box, with alignment tabs on the inside ensuring the lid stays centered.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_md5.jpg" target="_self">The lid is surrounded by yet another evenly sized gap. To ensure it stays centered, alignment ribs on the inside locate it quite precisely.<br>To learn even more about this concept, Teaching Tech has made a video about the topic (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/8dhFhU7Nl_0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/8dhFhU7Nl_0" target="_self">YouTube</a>).Another significant factor for appearance is surface texture. With 3d-printing, we generally do not have much control about them. Especially vertical surfaces will always prominently display the layer lines inherent to the process.With special print beds, like textured steel sheets, the bottom surface of parts can be refined. This allows for a very clean texture, but is of course quite limited because only one surface of each part can get this treatment. Sometimes, it is actually desirable to avoid having a bed surface on a part, to keep all sides looking more even. One way to do this is rotating parts to a diagonal angle relative to the print bed.For vertical surfaces, where the layer lines are sometimes destroying the aesthetics of a part, a trick has been developed to help hiding them. Fuzzy skin adds irregularities to each layer perimeter, building up to a surface that appears more rough, but without prominent layer lines.Fuzzy skin also has a pleasant feel to it, if tuned correctly, which has made it a popular choice for 3d-printed grips and handles.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_md5.jpg" target="_self">Fuzzy skin on a tool grip makes for a nice appearance and pleasant feeling while holding.<br>Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fuzzy-skin_246186" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fuzzy-skin_246186" target="_self">Prusa Research</a>Another nice side-effect of the nature of 3d-printing is the fact that it is laughably simple to add text or symbols to a part. No need for stickers, decals, or labor-intensive engravings. There is no excuse to not add text to a printed part.A starting point is to make it a habit to add part numbers into each part of a larger design. This way it is easy to keep everything organized. Especially when iterating on a part a lot, having the revision index printed onto it can reduce confusion quite a lot.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/c4c678dc209b77c332b0ce6c9918c68b_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/c4c678dc209b77c332b0ce6c9918c68b_md5.jpg" target="_self">An enclosure with a label text engraved into it.There are two ways to add text or symbols: Either the text gets cut into the surface, which is called engraving. Or the text can be raised over the surface, called embossing. For the most part, engraving leads to much cleaner results with 3d-printing. This is especially true as the font size gets smaller.Regarding orientation, the best results will be achieved by placing the text such that it is vertical to the print surface. This way it gets printed as part of the perimeter lines where the printer can achieve the most detail.Experience has shown that most printers can print a text with 0.6&nbsp;mm minimum stroke width and engraved to 0.5&nbsp;mm depth without issues.For the final chapter, I want to investigate a completely different design approach for 3d-printing — vase mode design. Inherently, the FFF 3d-printing process is not volumetric. Volumetric parts are only achieved by using lines of plastic, fused together such that a volume emerges. But whether this is the most efficient way to make use of the 3d-printing process is a question worth asking.Vase mode is an alternative approach where only a hollow shell of a part is printed, using a single perimeter line. Instead of individual layers, the Z height slowly increases such that filament is laid down in a spiral. This has a number of advantageous consequences:
It is very efficient because 100% of the print time is spent extruding filament.
Due to the lack of individual layers, there is no seam in the surface.
As the printer never stops printing, no stringing issues can occur.
It is very fast because the least amount of plastic is used to represent a part's shape.
It can also leads to very light parts due to the decreased filament usage.
The big downside is of course that parts become very unstable due to the missing internal support. For certain kinds of parts, especially artistic ones, this may not be a problem. Even for functional parts, like vases — where this technique got its name — the strength might already be sufficient.<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_md5.png" target="_self"><br>Vase design by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/866587-sculptural-vase-vase-mode" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/866587-sculptural-vase-vase-mode" target="_self">@Slimprint</a>With vase mode, the most important factor to part strength is surface geometry. Surfaces that are flat or only bend in only one direction perform the worst. Intricate shapes often show much more strength. This can be seen especially with the impressive strength some vase designs manage to achieve.<br>What those vases achieve through style can be used for technical designs in the form of beading patterns. They describe features that are added to thin sheet-material parts to give them additional strength. CNC-Kitchen has made a video about using beading patterns for 3d-printing where this concept is explored in more detail (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs" target="_self">YouTube</a>). There is also a german web-book going into detail about beading patterns in general (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://4ming.de/de/forming-handbuch/leichtbau-durch-sicken-fachbuch" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://4ming.de/de/forming-handbuch/leichtbau-durch-sicken-fachbuch" target="_self">4ming.de</a>).<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/59775235711daac7c682655117064916_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/59775235711daac7c682655117064916_md5.jpg" target="_self"><br>Beading pattern on a box shown by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs" target="_self">CNC-Kitchen</a><br>Interestingly, it is possible to adapt vase mode for even more uses. The trick is in viewing vase mode as a way to have very tight control over the way that a printer extrudes filament. A part is designed such that its surface perimeters describe a path for the printer which ultimately results in the intended geometry. An impressive example of this is the stackable tray designed by FPacheco (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/514142-vase-mode-stackable-hextray-60-mm-hexagons" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/514142-vase-mode-stackable-hextray-60-mm-hexagons" target="_self">Printables</a>).<br><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/af40fb4d1868d9c7e4ae7b67fc7578f6_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/af40fb4d1868d9c7e4ae7b67fc7578f6_md5.jpg" target="_self">This tray looks nothing like a vase-mode part but is the result of very careful and clever design.While the resulting part for such designs looks nothing like a normal vase mode part, it still gets the 100% print time benefit of vase mode. Especially when a part shall be produced in high quantity, this may have significant impact.Alright, you have made it to the end. Below, you will find a final summary of all the design rules discussed in this blog post. Use them as a reference for your designs, as "sane defaults" when there is no good reason to deviate. But at the same time, these are no laws — there are many situations where doing things differently is the better choice. It is your job as the design engineer to make these decisions.I have thought long about where I should publish this information. For now, placing it here on my blog felt like the easiest choice. But such "rules" live from discussion and I would love to hear your opinions and to get talking about them. If enough interest emerges, I would be interested in turning this into an "open-source book" where others can contribute their own rules or suggest changes to the existing ones. My ultimate goal is finding the best approaches for design for 3d-printing. And such a feat is only achievable by the community at large.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/engineering/design-for-3d-printing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/engineering/design-for-3d-printing.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_md5.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_md5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[lessons]]></title><link>projects/school-25-26/language/lessons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/language/lessons.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[classic-questions]]></title><description><![CDATA[

that had governed his family for generations. He rose quietly from his reed mat, careful not to disturb his wife Sita and their two young children who slept soundly on their own mats nearby. The brick walls of their small home on the outskirts of Mohenjo-daro trapped the previous day's heat, making the air inside warm and heavy despite the predawn hour.Paras stepped out into the courtyard, breathing in deeply. The air felt different today—heavy with moisture and promise. He gazed up at the sky where the stars were beginning to fade. Dark clouds loomed on the distant horizon. After months of scorching heat that had baked the earth hard as fired pottery, the signs were unmistakable. The monsoon would arrive today.He crossed the courtyard to the small shrine tucked into a corner wall and knelt before the small terracotta figure of the Mother Goddess. Paras placed a fresh offering of grain before the deity, touching his forehead to the ground."Bring gentle rains and fertile fields," he whispered, the same prayer his father and grandfather had offered for countless generations.By the time he completed his morning devotions, Sita had risen and was grinding grain at the stone quern in the courtyard."The monsoon comes today," Paras said simply.Sita nodded, her hands never stopping their rhythmic movement. "I've prepared extra flour for the offerings," she replied. "The children and I will go to the Great Bath for the ceremony."Their ten-year-old son Indra appeared, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "Will there be no lessons today, Father?" he asked hopefully. For several months now, Indra had been attending the scribes' school near the city center, learning the mysterious symbols that merchants and officials used to record grain, livestock, and trade goods."Not today," Paras replied with a smile. "Today we prepare for the waters."After a simple breakfast of flatbread and lentils, Paras and Indra set out for their fields that lay beyond the city walls. They walked past the familiar sights of Mohenjo-daro as it awakened—the straight, orderly streets already filling with people, the merchants setting up their wares in the marketplace, workers heading toward the large granaries where much of the city's grain was stored.Unlike some of their neighbors who kept homes solely within the city walls and traveled to their fields each day, Paras's family maintained two dwellings—their small city home and a simpler shelter near their fields. This arrangement allowed them to stay close to their crops during crucial growing seasons while still maintaining connection to city life.As they passed through the northern gate, Paras noticed an increased number of carts entering the city, laden with goods from distant villages."The traders are hurrying to arrive before the roads become impassable," he explained to Indra. "Once the rains begin, travel will be difficult for many weeks."Their plot of land lay about half an hour's walk from the city walls—fertile soil irrigated by a series of channels that connected to the larger canal system branching from the mighty Indus River. These channels, maintained by collective labor under the direction of city officials, were the lifeblood of agriculture in the region."Today we must clear the irrigation channels," Paras instructed his son as they reached their fields. "When the rains come, the water must flow smoothly."They were not alone in this task. Neighboring farmers were also out in their fields, repairing embankments and clearing silt from channels. The community worked with practiced efficiency—each family responsible for their section but all understanding that the success of the system depended on everyone's diligence.By midday, the sky had darkened considerably. The air hung hot and still around them as they worked. Paras straightened his back, stretching muscles that had been bent over irrigation ditches for hours. He squinted at the approaching clouds."Go to the shelter and bring out the offering vessels," he told Indra. "It's time."From their field shelter, Indra retrieved a small copper pot and several clay bowls—items kept specifically for the monsoon ritual. Paras placed them carefully at the edge of their field, filling the bowls with small portions of saved grain, a piece of cloth dyed with indigo, and a tiny bull figurine carved from soapstone—representations of the things they hoped the coming agricultural season would bring: abundant food, successful crafts, and healthy livestock.The distant rumble of thunder rolled across the plains as other farmers completed their own preparations. A cool breeze suddenly swept across the fields, bringing relief from the oppressive heat for the first time in months."Look there!" Indra pointed toward the city.From their vantage point, they could see a procession emerging from the city gates—priests from the Great Bath, identifiable by their white garments, leading a group of officials and city residents. Even at this distance, they could hear the rhythmic beating of drums."They come to bless the fields before the waters arrive," Paras explained. "When you return to the city with your mother, you will see the greater ceremony at the Bath."The procession moved along the main pathways between the fields, stopping at intervals where the priests made offerings and performed ritual gestures. Farmers paused in their work, heads bowed in respect. Though they wouldn't come to Paras's particular field—there were too many to visit individually—their blessing was understood to extend to all the lands surrounding Mohenjo-daro.The first large droplets of rain began to fall as the procession returned toward the city walls. Paras and Indra lifted their faces to the sky, feeling the cool touch of water on their skin."We should return home before the downpour," Paras said, gathering their tools. As if in response to his words, the scattered drops quickened, and a flash of lightning illuminated the darkened landscape.By the time they reached the city gates, rain was falling steadily. The streets, so carefully planned with their precise grid layout, were designed for this very season. Slight gradients directed water toward the sophisticated drainage system that ran alongside each road. Already, water was beginning to flow through the covered drains, carrying away debris before it could accumulate.As they approached their neighborhood, they saw Sita and their seven-year-old daughter Priya returning from the Great Bath ceremony, protected from the rain by woven reed mats held over their heads. Sita's face was marked with ochre powder—a sign of her participation in the ritual."The priests say the rains will be favorable this year," she reported as they all hurried into the shelter of their home. "The omens are good."Inside, they changed out of their wet clothes and gathered in the central room as the rain intensified. Like all homes in Mohenjo-daro, theirs was built with the monsoon in mind. The thick brick walls insulated against both heat and moisture, while the flat roof collected rainwater that flowed through clay pipes into storage vessels in their courtyard.As the day darkened into evening, their small dwelling was filled with the sounds of the strengthening storm—rain hammering on the roof, water gurgling through drainage pipes, occasional claps of thunder that made young Priya hide her face in her mother's lap."Tell us about the Great Bath ceremony," Paras requested as they shared their evening meal."The water tank was filled to the brim," Priya reported excitedly. "The priests made it change color with special powders.""And the city governor was there," Sita added, "with all the important merchants and craft masters. There were offerings of grain and cloth at each corner of the Bath, and the head priest spoke of how the Mother Goddess sends the waters to renew the earth."Through the night, the family slept to the steady drumming of rain on their roof. Paras awoke several times, listening to the sounds of water flowing through the city's drainage systems. The engineers of Mohenjo-daro had built well—their understanding of water management had allowed this great city to thrive despite the seasonal extremes.When morning came, the rain continued steadily. Paras checked their courtyard, nodding with satisfaction as he saw the rainfall collection system working properly, fresh water flowing into their storage jars. In these early days of monsoon, they would collect as much clean water as possible."No field work today," he announced to the family. "The waters must soak the earth first."Instead, the day would be spent on indoor tasks—Sita weaving cotton cloth on her small loom, Paras repairing tools and making rope from hemp fibers, Priya learning household skills from her mother, and Indra practicing his writing by etching symbols onto a small clay tablet.Over the coming weeks, life in Mohenjo-daro would adapt to the monsoon rhythm. The markets would move to covered areas, children would splash in puddles between downpours, and eventually, when the initial heavy rains subsided into a more predictable pattern, farmers would return to their fields to plant the crops that would sustain the city—wheat, barley, and cotton, the valuable fiber that Mohenjo-daro traders exchanged with distant lands.Later that day, as the rain lightened briefly, Paras stood in the doorway of their home, watching city life continue despite the weather. Water flowed efficiently through the street drains, traders had erected awnings to protect their goods, and people moved purposefully along the wide, straight avenues.He caught sight of a merchant's cart making its way up the street, the bullocks straining against the muddy conditions. The cart was laden with goods from the coast—shells, beads, and materials that would eventually make their way to workshops where artisans would transform them into the fine crafts for which Mohenjo-daro was known throughout the trading world.This was the sophisticated urban life that complemented his existence as a farmer—a remarkable balance that defined the Indus Valley Civilization. Unlike the nomadic peoples beyond their territories or the more rigid societies in distant Mesopotamia, the people of Mohenjo-daro had created something unique: a civilization where farmers, craftspeople, merchants, and administrators lived in ordered harmony, where engineering marvels like their water systems created stability despite nature's extremes.As Indra joined him in the doorway, Paras rested a hand on his son's shoulder. "The waters bring life," he said simply, gesturing toward their city—this marvel of brick and planning that rose from the Indus floodplain. "Without the monsoon, there would be no Mohenjo-daro."In the distance, the Great Bath stood as the centerpiece of the city—a sacred place that honored the waters that both threatened and nourished their civilization. As another generation prepared to plant and harvest, to trade and build, to worship and learn, the cycle continued. The great city had flourished for centuries before Paras's birth and would continue long after him, its remarkable achievements—urban planning, standardized weights, sophisticated crafts, and writing—sustained by the coming waters of the annual monsoon.What neither Paras nor any other citizen of this great civilization could know was that, centuries later, the mighty city would eventually be abandoned—likely due to changes in the very river that gave it life. But for now, as the life-giving rains fell across the Indus Valley, Mohenjo-daro stood at its height, a testament to human ingenuity and adaptation in one of the world's first great urban civilizations.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/mohenjo-daro-monsoon.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/mohenjo-daro-monsoon.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[vesuvius-eruption-pompeii]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lucius Caecilius Iucundus awoke before dawn, as was his custom. At forty-five, the banker had long established his routines in this thriving port city of Pompeii. The household was already stirring around him—his two household slaves, Melissa and Demetrius, preparing for the day's tasks while his son Marcus still slept soundly in his room across the atrium.As Lucius washed his face in the basin of cool water Melissa had prepared, he felt a slight tremor beneath his feet. Nothing unusual—small earth tremors had been common in Pompeii for the past several days. In fact, they had grown quite accustomed to them since the larger quake some seventeen years earlier that had damaged many buildings in the city. That earthquake in 62 CE had been devastating, but Pompeii had rebuilt, more beautiful and prosperous than before."Will you be taking breakfast at home today, Domine?" Melissa asked as she brought in his toga."No," Lucius replied, allowing her to help him arrange the heavy wool garment in its formal folds. "I have business at the forum this morning. I'll eat something at Stephanus's thermopolium on the way."The summer heat was already building as Lucius stepped out onto the street. The city was coming alive—bakers had been working for hours, the smell of fresh bread wafting from their shops. Merchants were setting up their stalls in the forum, and farmers from the countryside were bringing in carts laden with fresh produce. Mount Vesuvius loomed in the background, as it always had—a familiar presence that most Pompeians hardly noticed anymore, despite the small plume of smoke that had been visible for the past few days.At the thermopolium, a fast-food counter where many Pompeians took their meals, Stephanus greeted Lucius warmly."The usual, banker?" he asked, already ladling a portion of lentil stew into a clay bowl from one of the round terracotta containers embedded in his serving counter."Yes, and some of that wine from Herculaneum," Lucius replied, placing a small copper coin on the counter. As he ate, he chatted with other morning patrons—a fuller named Quintus who complained about the water supply to his workshop, and a merchant who had just arrived from Misenum with news of naval exercises taking place there under the command of Pliny the Elder, prefect of the fleet."Strange cloud over the mountain today," the merchant commented, gesturing toward Vesuvius. Lucius turned to look. Indeed, the usual wisp of smoke had transformed into something more substantial—a tall column rising straight up into the sky."Probably nothing," Lucius shrugged. "The mountain always steams a bit in summer."By midday, Lucius had completed his business at the forum, collecting debts and arranging new loans. The day had grown unusually dark, and the column above Vesuvius had expanded into a massive cloud, towering above the mountain like a pine tree with an immensely long trunk and branches spreading at the top. Occasional rumbles could be heard, and many citizens were now pointing and staring at the mountain.Lucius hurried home, finding his son Marcus standing in the doorway, looking anxiously at the sky."Father, what's happening?" the sixteen-year-old asked."I'm not certain," Lucius replied, trying to maintain his composure. "But I think we should prepare to leave the city for a day or two, until this passes."Inside their home, Melissa and Demetrius were already gathering valuables—the household's strongbox containing important documents and coin, some jewelry, and a few family heirlooms."Should we go to our villa in Misenum?" Marcus asked, referring to their country home several miles away along the coast."No," Lucius decided, recalling the words of the merchant. "The fleet is stationed there for exercises. It will be crowded. We'll head inland instead."A loud crash from outside interrupted their preparations. A roof tile had fallen, shattered by a rock that had plummeted from the sky. Lucius stepped out into the garden and looked up. What appeared to be small stones were beginning to rain down—light-colored pumice, still warm to the touch. The sky had grown darker still, now an ominous gray-brown."We must leave immediately," Lucius ordered, returning inside. "Gather only what you can carry. Quickly!"As they prepared to depart, a frantic knocking came at their door. It was Julia, their elderly neighbor, clutching a small statue of her household gods."Lucius, my slaves have fled," she said, her voice trembling. "I have no one to help me.""Come with us," he replied without hesitation. "Marcus, help Julia. Demetrius, take the bags."The streets were chaotic. Families poured out of homes, some pulling carts laden with possessions, others carrying only what they could hold in their arms. The pumice stones were falling more heavily now, accumulating on the ground, making walking difficult. The air had grown acrid, burning their throats and eyes."Cover your heads!" Lucius instructed, giving Marcus his own cloak to drape over Julia. The group moved toward the Nuceria Gate on the southeastern side of the city, opposite the mountain, joining a stream of other citizens fleeing in the same direction.The journey was slow. The falling pumice, now several inches deep, impeded their progress. Occasionally, larger rocks would fall, causing injuries to those unfortunate enough to be struck. All around them, people called out for missing family members. Others prayed loudly to the gods for deliverance.By late afternoon, the sky had darkened to near total blackness. Only occasional flashes of lightning from the mountain provided momentary illumination of the terrifying scene. The weight of accumulated pumice caused roofs to collapse throughout the city, adding to the cacophony of destruction."We must find shelter!" Lucius shouted over the din, as a heavier fall of rock began. They huddled against a wall, trying to shield themselves, when a tremendous roar came from the direction of Vesuvius. Looking back, they saw a horrifying sight—a massive cloud of superheated gas and ash surging down the mountainside at incredible speed."Run!" Lucius screamed, grabbing Julia's arm. But it was too late.The pyroclastic surge—a deadly cloud of gas, ash, and rock heated to hundreds of degrees—engulfed them in seconds. Their final moments were mercifully quick as they breathed in the scalding air, falling where they stood. Within minutes, they were covered in a layer of ash that would continue to build over the coming hours and days.In the bay, ships commanded by Pliny the Elder attempted rescue operations for those fleeing to the shore, but many, including the admiral himself, would perish in the attempt.Far away in Misenum, Pliny the Younger, the admiral's seventeen-year-old nephew, watched the mountain's fury and later recorded the event: "Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... It was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night."When the eruption finally subsided days later, Pompeii lay buried under approximately 20 feet of volcanic debris. The city and its inhabitants—shopkeepers and slaves, bankers and bakers, children and elders—were frozen in time, a perfect snapshot of Roman life in 79 CE that would remain hidden for nearly 1,700 years.Lucius, Marcus, Melissa, Demetrius, and Julia—like approximately 2,000 other citizens of Pompeii—became unwitting witnesses to history, their final moments preserved in the volcanic ash, their story waiting to be uncovered by archaeologists who would one day piece together the events of that fateful August day when Vesuvius awoke.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/vesuvius-eruption-pompeii.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/vesuvius-eruption-pompeii.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[world-history-map]]></title><description><![CDATA[We will use QGIS to make a time-evolving map that puts a place and time on things we learn during history this year.

As events occur or things change, we'll either edit the shapes with a new version for the given time, or we'll add new stuff (or remove things that disappear).Every history session should be driven by this project - we're studying in order to build up this map. The map is our final project, but it will also hopefully make this stuff stick in the brain better.Each data item on the map should have the option to attach documents and images, and to keep a list of URLs relevant to whatever it is.

Writing should be integrated into every subject
Sentences are the foundation of all writing
The most important stages of writing are planning and revising
Grammar should be taught in context of student writing, not separately.
Writing is a powerful learning tool for any subject when it's embedded well
Students need explicit instruction in writing, even if they are avid readers.
Instead of working on detailed syntactic knowledge of parts of speech, this approach focuses on the functions they have within a sentence. It simplifies the approach to thinking about appositives (noun modifiers), coordinating conjunctions, and other things that have very clear roles.
Fragment or Sentence? (p. 38 for details) Take sentences about current study topic and remove all capitalization and punctuation, then turn some of them into fragments.
Students identify which are fragments, and correct all sentences (including content, and patching up fragments) Unscramble scrambled sentences (p. 41 for details) Scramble the words and remove capitalization and punctuation in sentences either from lesson material or about it
Students rebuild correct sentences (both content and structure) Correcting run-ons (p. 42) Convert a string of sentences into a preposterous run-on and put it on the board every day. Students split it into independent sentences to correct the run-on
Try to ID the typical joining syntax they use and have them search for that (comma, "and", etc) to try to self-correct run-ons Make sure students can use and identify all four sentence types:
Declarative
Imperative
Interrogative
Exclamatory
Varying the sentence types among these four will help add interest to a piece of writing, and possibly generate some new ideas for how to convey the intended message. In this class of exercise, you give them a kernel sentence, which is a technically complete sentence that's stripped to the bare essence of what's required. You also give them a few question words (who, what, where, when, why, how). Their job is to turn the sentence kernel into a much more developed sentence that answers the question provided question words for the reader.The process has two phases:
Write notes that answer the question words. These shouldn't be complete sentences, and they should be written with a shorthand that uses arrows, lines, and other quick symbols to denote common connections between ideas
Write the actual sentence using the content from the notes.
Example: (in the context of Christopher Columbus) He crossed the Atlantic ocean. who, why, when
Example answer: In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic ocean in search of a westward route to Asia.
List question words on a wall chart in this order: who, what, when, where, why. and how. Provide kernel sentences that express complete thoughts but are not commands, questions, or fragments.
Level 1 students should start expanding sentences using the question words when, where, and why.
There should be only one pronoun in a kernel.
Students should write answers to question words in note form on dotted lines and write their expanded sentences on solid lines.
Students should begin their expanded sentences with when if it is one of the question words.
Students' expanded sentences should not add, delete, or substitute information (unless it's replacing a pronoun).
Use sentence expansion activities to help students anticipate what the reader needs to know.
Use sentence expansion activities to check students' comprehension of content.
Note-taking is a powerful strategy for gaining and retaining knowledge.
Below mid-third grade, note-taking should be limited to key words and phrases. After that point, begin to add symbols and abbreviations at your discretion.
Provide a sentence stem on a topic from class. They should complete it in three different ways using because, but, and so. The stem should look something like this:
Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road because ...
Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road, but ...
Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road, so ...
Make sure they understand to write a complete sentence that begins with the fragment, not make up their own sentence or write a fragment to stick on the end. They should write the entire thing.This section starts out with recognizing the four kinds of sentences (Declarative, Imperative, Interrogative, Exclamation). All of the exercises in here are way too basic, but there's still value in actually practicing varying sentence structure in real writing.Two things seem to stand out:
3. Challenge them to write a question that could be an essay question on a test about one of our subjects.
4. Write a paragraph using each sentence type (or some subset of sentence types) once. Forcing them to step out of declarative style in an essay might improve the flow and feel of their writing and free up some ideas at the same time.See chart of transitions on p. 89This is an area where some work will pay off. Types of Transitions
Time and sequence: provide sequence of events, steps in a process
Conclusion: express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution
Illustration: give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement
Change of direction: signal contrasting thoughts
Emphasis: prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated
Start with partial sentences, that either need a transition word, or that have the transition word but are missing the content that follows. After that, move on to sequences of sentences that need to be transitioned into each other.This would be easy to combine with sentence kernels and question words to practice scaffolding ideas into flowing paragraphs.Another name for a noun, or further explanation of a noun. There are several exercise types:
Identify appositives - given a sentence with an appositive, pick out the appositive
Matching appositives - exercise knowledge of whatever subject you choose by scrambling a list of nouns and appositives that match them, and have the students unscramble things (word match puzzle)
Add an appositive - given a sentence with a clearly marked space to fill, add an appositive appropriate to the noun.
Brainstorm appositives - given a noun, brainstorm possible appositives that could apply.
Appositive to sentence - given the appostive, create a sentence around it.
Topical - Given a topic, write a sentence with an appositive.
Given a list of short, declarative sentences, use conjunctions and transitions to turn them into a single sentence that expresses all of the ideas.A paragraph is a group of sentences that includes details supporting a specific point. Grade paragraphs on a scale that considers these four things:
Structure: The sentences are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader.
Coherence: The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal the connection, including indications of change of direction or emphasis.
Unity: Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph
Well-constructed sentences: The sentences are gramatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary.
A single-paragraph outline is an outline of one paragraph. The process to create it works like this:
Identify topic, audience, and purpose. If there will be many connected paragraphs, the audience will be the same, but the topic and purpose may change.
Create a topic sentence that clearly expresses the specific topic of this paragraph. Vagueness here is not okay.
Make a list of supporting details as notes, not full sentences. These will become the sentences of the body of the paragraph, but they may not be one-to-one in number.
Create a concluding sentence that references the main idea but does not restate it. If this is part of a larger piece, it's important for the conclusion to lead into the topic of the next paragraph. Distinguish a topic sentence from details: Given a list of at least three sentences from a paragraph, identify the topic sentence and the details that support it.
Identify the T.S. and then put the details in the correct order. Given three or more sentences, first identify which is the topic, then put the paragraph into a logical order with good flow.
Given a T.S., select relevant details from a list: The details should include related things that both support and fail to support the main idea. Pick out the good ones.
Eliminate irrelevant details from a list
Generate details from your own knowledge
Practice the three strategies for topic and concluding sentences: Sentence types
Subordinating conjunctions
Appositives Given a topic or prompt, generate a topic sentence.
Given details, generate a topic sentence.
Given a topic sentence and details, generate a conclusion sentence
Given a topic or prompt, generate a single-paragraph outline independently.
There are several standard "text structures" that are used for different kinds of paragraph. These can be used as the target for a SPO, picked based on the paragraph's purpose.
Narrative - telling a story about something, or a sequence of events
Descriptive
Problem/solution - describe an overall problem and how it is solved by explaining smaller problems and their solutions, and showing how they work together to solve the bigger issue
cause and effect - topic is the overall cause/effect, describe the contributing causes and effects inside
Pro and Con - analyze somethign in terms of desirability by showing its most important benefits and problems.
compare and contrast - Compare two things by describing ways in which they are similar and different
Opinion/persuasive - express an opinion and explain reasons why it should be accepted <a href=".?query=tag:teacher" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#teacher">#teacher</a> Continue outlining The Writing Revolution <a data-href="2025-08-19" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-08-19</a>

<br>As a bonus project, we could use a <a data-href="grbl-software" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">grbl-software</a> controller connected with some small steppers to control the stage movement. If we combine that with the focus-stack software, it would be a great way to make high quality images, at least for non-moving targets. Motorizing lateral movement would also be incredibly useful.If the kids learn Astro, we could connect the camera to a web app that allows the user to control the stage through the browser.End game could be to use computer vision to tag a target, and have it keep that target in focus and in-frame despite movement.The illuminator will be made from a CREE XLamp XHP35 on a star-board. We will have to apply a heat sink and thermal glue, as well as a cooling fan. The brightness and (maybe) fan speed will be controllable through the RaspberryPi using PWM over a GPIO pin into a MOSFET power transistor.We will need designs for mounting the camera and the light source. The light source will need a duct for cooling air. The power supply will be from a plug-in wall adapter that outputs 12V DC.A possible future direction might be to motorize the focus knobs to enable fully-automatic focus-stack images and remote operation from the web interface of the RasPI Cam GUI.I would like to have a way to capture a focus-stack automatically. It should take a sequence of 10 or so photos in rapid succession, as the focus knob is slowly turned through the range of focus. Images should be output with the selected name, numbered, and then automatically fed into focus-stack to create the final output.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/engineering/projects/microscope-camera.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/engineering/projects/microscope-camera.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mounting the Camera]]></title><description><![CDATA[ <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/" target="_self">Arduino Language Reference</a> <br>

Yucatan PeninsulaI am born in wonder and frustration. John Lloyd Stephens scribbles observations across my first pages as Frederick Catherwood's pencil captures the intricate stone carvings before us. The locals call this place "Copán," though we suspect that is not its ancient name."These symbols are clearly not alphabetic," Stephens writes in his careful hand. "Too complex for mere decoration, too systematic for random art. But what do they mean?"Catherwood's drawings fill my pages—elaborate glyphs showing human faces, animals, geometric patterns, numbers marked by bars and dots. His artistic eye captures details that daguerreotypes cannot, but even his skilled hand struggles with the alien beauty of these symbols.A Maya guide, Don José, watches us work. When Stephens points to a particularly ornate carving, the old man shrugs. "Los antiguos," he says. The ancients. As if a thousand years have built an unbridgeable gulf between his people and these stones.I feel the weight of mystery settling into my pages. These glyphs seem to pulse with meaning just beyond comprehension, like words spoken in a room next door—familiar yet unintelligible.Ernst Förstemann's Collection, Dresden, 1880Forty years have passed, and I have grown thick with new observations. My current keeper, Ernst Förstemann, peers at me through wire-rimmed spectacles in his cluttered study at the Royal Library of Dresden. Before him lies the Dresden Codex, one of only four surviving Maya books, its bark paper covered with the same mysterious glyphs that filled my earliest pages."Numbers," he mutters, adding another note to my margins. "These bars and dots are clearly numerical. Five dots, then a bar for five, then combinations..."He has cracked part of the code. Through meticulous comparison, he has identified the Maya counting system—base 20, using bars and dots, with a shell symbol for zero. A breakthrough! But the calendrical calculations he reveals only deepen the mystery. These ancient scribes tracked time with mathematical precision that rivals our own."Look at this," he writes on a fresh page. "They calculated the orbit of Venus to 584 days—more accurate than the Greeks or Romans. Yet we still cannot read their history, their names, their stories."A letter arrives from America. Cyrus Thomas, working for the Bureau of Ethnology, has been studying Maya inscriptions across Guatemala and Mexico. His sketches join my collection, showing that the writing system was used across the entire Maya world for over a thousand years.But Thomas, like Förstemann, sees only calendars and astronomy. "These monuments record dates and celestial events," he concludes. "The Maya were obsessed with time itself."I feel the frustration in their ink. They have found the skeleton of Maya writing—its mathematical bones—but the flesh of language remains hidden.Property of Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Carnegie Institution, 1958New hands turn my pages now. Tatiana Proskouriakoff, a Russian-born architect turned archaeologist, spreads her drawings across the table at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Unlike my previous keepers, she approaches the glyphs not as an antiquarian collecting curiosities, but as an architect reading blueprints."Everyone assumes these are just calendar stones," she writes in clear, confident script. "But look at the patterns. At Piedras Negras, the dates don't just record astronomical events—they follow human lifespans."Her revolutionary insight fills my pages with new energy. She has identified "Glyph A" and "Glyph F"—birth and accession dates. Suddenly, the stones are not just tracking celestial movements but human lives. Kings and queens emerge from the mathematical fog, their reigns measured not just in years but in personal triumphs and defeats."Stela 14 shows a woman's accession," she notes, her excitement evident in the slightly shaky handwriting. "For 60 years, scholars assumed all Maya rulers were men. But here is a queen, ruling in her own right."I feel myself transforming. Where once I held only calendars and cosmic calculations, now I contain the whispers of royal dynasties. Proskouriakoff has proven that Maya hieroglyphs record history—real people doing real things in real time.But still, we cannot read their words. We know THAT they spoke across the centuries, but not WHAT they said.Department of Maya Studies, Yale University, 1965My pages grow heavy with academic debate. Sir Eric Thompson, the great British Mayanist, has dominated the field for decades with his theory that Maya hieroglyphs are purely ideographic—each symbol representing a complete concept, like Chinese characters, with no phonetic component."The Maya mind was fundamentally different from ours," Thompson argues in a letter to a colleague, his flowing script filling another page of my collection. "They thought in symbols and concepts, not in the crude phonetics of alphabetic writing. Their glyphs capture pure ideas, floating free from the limitations of spoken language."But doubt creeps into my margins. A young Russian scholar named Yuri Knorosov has been studying Maya writing from Moscow, using principles learned from deciphering ancient Egyptian and other scripts. His articles, translated and pasted into my pages, challenge everything Thompson believes."All true writing systems," Knorosov argues, "must have phonetic elements. The Maya glyphs, like Egyptian hieroglyphs, combine logographic symbols (representing whole words) with phonetic signs (representing sounds)."Thompson dismisses this "communist propaganda," but I feel the truth stirring in Knorosov's work. He has identified phonetic values for several glyphs by comparing them to words in modern Maya languages. If he is right, the hieroglyphs don't just record abstract concepts—they preserve the actual sounds of ancient Maya speech.The academic world divides. Thompson's followers defend the old interpretation while a new generation of scholars, inspired by Knorosov's insights, begins to hear voices in the stones.Property of David Stuart, Age 12, 1977I have passed into remarkable hands. David Stuart, barely a teenager, sits at his family's kitchen table in Washington D.C., surrounded by rubbings of Maya inscriptions. His father, an archaeologist, has brought home work from the field, and the boy studies the glyphs with fresh eyes unburdened by decades of scholarly orthodoxy."This glyph," he writes in his careful adolescent script, "appears on monuments from Palenque whenever they mention the great king K'inich Janaab Pakal. It must be part of his name."Around the same time, other young scholars join the revolution. Linda Schele, studying architecture at the University of Texas, attends her first Maya conference in 1973 and becomes obsessed with the hieroglyphs decorating the buildings she loves. Floyd Lounsbury at Yale applies rigorous linguistic analysis to the scripts.My pages explode with new discoveries as these scholars build on Knorosov's foundation:
"Royal names are emerging everywhere," Schele writes. "Pacal the Great of Palenque, Jasaw Chan K'inich of Tikal, Lady Six Sky of Naranjo..."
"The glyphs for 'mother of' and 'father of' have been identified," Stuart adds. "We can now trace royal bloodlines across generations."
"Warfare glyphs are becoming clear," notes another researcher. "'Star war' seems to indicate a type of devastating conquest."
I feel the ancient voices growing stronger. What once seemed like decorative symbols now pulse with human drama—births and deaths, victories and defeats, love and betrayal.Maya Meetings, University of Texas, 1986I am no longer a single collection but part of a vast network of shared knowledge. Photocopies of my pages circulate among scholars worldwide as the "Maya Meetings" at UT Austin become an annual pilgrimage for epigraphers hungry for the latest breakthroughs.The floodgates have opened. Every month brings new readings, new historical revelations:
The "Emblem Glyphs" that puzzled earlier scholars are revealed as city names and royal titles
Capture glyphs tell stories of kings taken prisoner in battle
Dedication formulas explain when and why monuments were erected
Personal names of sculptors and scribes emerge from temple inscriptions
David Stuart, now in his twenties, continues making groundbreaking discoveries. Linda Schele has become the field's most passionate evangelist, teaching workshops where participants experience the thrill of reading Maya texts for the first time."We are reading their actual words," she writes in one of my margins, her excitement palpable. "When a Maya scribe at Palenque wrote that 'the white-bone-snake descended from the sky,' we can read those precise words 1,300 years later. We are in direct communication with ancient minds."The stories pouring from the stones reshape our understanding of Maya civilization. Far from the peaceful astronomers earlier scholars imagined, the Maya emerge as passionate, complex people engaged in politics, warfare, art, and personal drama as compelling as any soap opera.Digital Archive, Various Institutions, 2000sI have evolved beyond physical pages. My contents now live in databases accessible to scholars worldwide. The Palenque Palace Tablet, the Quirigua monuments, the painted texts of Bonampak—all yield their secrets to a generation of epigraphers trained in the methods pioneered by Knorosov, Schele, Stuart, and their colleagues.New technologies enhance the work. Photographers use specialized lighting to reveal faded glyphs. Digital imaging allows scholars to manipulate contrast and examine inscriptions impossible to see with the naked eye. 3D scanning preserves monument texts threatened by erosion and vandalism.The ancient Maya speak more clearly now than they have for centuries:
King Itzamnaaj B'alam II of Yaxchilan proclaims his victories over rival cities
Lady K'ab'al Xook performs bloodletting rituals to commune with ancestors
A scribe at Copán signs his masterpiece: "It is the work of Aj Maxam, he of Copán"
Modern Maya communities, descendants of the people who created these texts, participate in workshops where they learn to read their ancestors' words. The hieroglyphs are no longer mysterious symbols in museum cases but a living connection to an unbroken cultural tradition.From the perspective of the complete archive, 2023I have witnessed the greatest decipherment achievement of the modern era. From complete mystery to substantial comprehension in less than two centuries—a blink of an eye in historical terms, yet a lifetime of dedicated scholarship.The journey taught profound lessons about how knowledge grows:
Collaboration across generations: Each scholar built on predecessors' work, even when challenging their conclusions
The power of fresh perspectives: Breakthroughs often came from young minds or outsiders unburdened by established dogma
Persistence in the face of mystery: Decades of patient work preceded the dramatic revelations of the 1970s and 1980s
The universality of human expression: Once decoded, Maya texts revealed people concerned with the same fundamental themes that drive humans everywhere—power, love, death, legacy, and meaning
Most importantly, the decipherment restored voice to a silenced people. The Maya civilization, once seen as mysteriously different from our own, emerged as recognizably human. Their kings worried about legitimacy, their queens wielded political power, their scribes took pride in their craft, and their people celebrated victories and mourned defeats just as we do today.I began as a collection of puzzling symbols sketched by Victorian explorers. I evolved into a bridge across time, carrying the voices of ancient America into the modern world. The Maya hieroglyphs, once as mysterious as alien artifacts, now speak to us in words we can understand, telling stories that remind us of our shared humanity across the centuries.The greatest discovery was not any single glyph or text, but the realization that the past is never truly lost—it simply waits for the right minds, equipped with the right tools and guided by the right questions, to hear its whispered secrets and restore its voice to the world.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/deciphering-maya-glyphs.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/deciphering-maya-glyphs.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[hammurabis-code]]></title><description><![CDATA[Babylon, circa 1750 BCEEnlil-bani wiped the sweat from his brow as he counted the silver pieces in his leather pouch for the third time. The morning sun cast long shadows across the bustling marketplace of Babylon, and already the air thrummed with the voices of merchants hawking their wares. Date sellers called out the sweetness of their fruit, while pottery vendors clinked their clay vessels to demonstrate their quality. But Enlil-bani's mind was elsewhere, focused on the meeting that would determine his family's fate.Three months ago, his younger brother Marduk-nasir had borrowed two minas of silver to purchase a flock of sheep, promising to repay the debt after selling the wool at the spring festival. The transaction had seemed straightforward—brothers helping brothers, as their father had taught them. But then the unthinkable happened: raiders from the northern hills had swept down like vultures, stealing the entire flock and leaving Marduk-nasir with nothing but trampled grass and bitter tears."The debt remains," Shamash-ilu the moneylender had declared coldly when Marduk-nasir pleaded for understanding. "Your misfortune does not erase what you owe me. The Code is clear—if you cannot pay, you and your family will work as my slaves until the debt is satisfied."Enlil-bani shuddered at the memory. Marduk-nasir had a wife and two young children. The thought of little Nabu-suma, barely old enough to walk, growing up in bondage made his stomach churn. Yet Shamash-ilu was not wrong about the law. Everyone in Babylon knew the great black stone pillar that stood in the temple courtyard, its surface covered with the wedge-shaped writing that proclaimed King Hammurabi's justice. The laws were carved deep into the stone, as permanent as the gods themselves."If a man borrows money and cannot repay it," Enlil-bani muttered, reciting the familiar words, "he shall give his wife, his son, or his daughter into slavery for three years to work off the debt."But as he walked toward the temple complex where Shamash-ilu waited, Enlil-bani's mind raced through other passages from the Code. His wife Tashmetum, the daughter of a scribe, had taught him to read the sacred writings when they were first married. "Knowledge of the law protects the innocent," she had said, "and ignorance invites oppression."The temple courtyard buzzed with activity. Priests performed the morning rituals while petitioners waited their turn to present cases before the judges. The great stela of Hammurabi dominated the space, its polished black surface gleaming in the sunlight. At its top, the king stood before Shamash, the sun god and patron of justice, receiving the divine laws that would govern his people.Shamash-ilu stood near the pillar with two burly men—his enforcers, no doubt, ready to seize Marduk-nasir's family if the debt could not be settled. The moneylender's round face bore a smug expression, as if he were already calculating the profits from three years of free labor."Enlil-bani!" he called out. "Have you brought the silver your brother owes me? Two minas, plus interest—three minas total.""I have brought silver," Enlil-bani replied carefully, "but first, I would have the judges examine this matter according to the King's law."Shamash-ilu's eyes narrowed. "What is there to examine? Your brother borrowed money. He cannot repay it. The law is clear.""The law is indeed clear," Enlil-bani agreed, then raised his voice so all in the courtyard could hear. "Let me read from the Code of our great King Hammurabi: 'If a merchant gives silver to a trading agent for conducting business, and the agent suffers a loss through no fault of his own—by robbery or enemy action—the loss shall not be charged against him.'"A murmur rippled through the crowd. Shamash-ilu's face reddened. "Your brother was not my trading agent! He borrowed money for his own purposes!""Was he not?" Enlil-bani pulled out a clay tablet from his robe. "This contract, witnessed by three men, shows that my brother agreed to purchase sheep on your behalf, to be raised and sold, with profits shared between you. The sheep were to remain yours until the debt was cleared. Is this not the arrangement of a merchant and his agent?"Shamash-ilu snatched the tablet, his hands trembling as he read. The contract was genuine—Tashmetum had helped Enlil-bani draft it the night before, carefully choosing language that transformed the loan into a business partnership."This... this is trickery!" Shamash-ilu sputtered."This is justice," came a stern voice. The crowd parted as Hammurabi-rabi, one of the king's appointed judges, approached. The old man's weathered face had witnessed countless disputes, and his knowledge of the law was legendary. "The Code protects honest traders from losses beyond their control. If the document is valid, then the young man acted as your agent, and the loss was due to raiders—clearly an enemy action."The judge examined the tablet carefully, checking the authenticity of the witnesses' seals. Finally, he nodded. "The contract is valid. The debt is void. The Code of our king protects the innocent from misfortune."Shamash-ilu's face went through several shades of red before settling on a defeated purple. He knew better than to argue with a royal judge's interpretation of Hammurabi's law. With a final glare at Enlil-bani, he stalked away, his enforcers trailing behind like disappointed jackals.As the crowd dispersed, Enlil-bani felt a hand on his shoulder. Marduk-nasir had arrived just in time to witness his liberation."Brother," Marduk-nasir whispered, his voice thick with emotion, "how can I ever repay you?"Enlil-bani smiled, thinking of his wife's wisdom and the hours they had spent studying the law by lamplight. "You can learn to read, as I did. Knowledge of the king's justice is the greatest shield a man can carry."That evening, as the brothers shared dinner with their families, little Nabu-suma played at their feet, free to grow up in his father's house rather than a moneylender's compound. The great Code of Hammurabi had served its purpose—not as a tool of oppression, but as a protection for those wise enough to understand its intricacies."The king's law is like the foundation of a house," Enlil-bani told his nephew as the boy climbed onto his lap. "It keeps everything above it strong and safe, but only if you know how to build upon it properly."Outside, the city of Babylon hummed with life, its citizens sleeping soundly under the protection of laws carved in stone and etched in justice. And in the temple courtyard, the great stela of Hammurabi stood silent sentinel, its ancient words still guarding the innocent and punishing the wicked, just as the god Shamash had intended when he gave the laws to the king so many years before.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/hammurabis-code.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/hammurabis-code.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[mayan-collapse]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tikal, Guatemala, circa 850 CEItzamnaaj crouched at the edge of the sacred cenote, his weathered hands trembling as he arranged the jade offerings on the limestone ledge. The water below, once crystal clear and brimming to the rim, had receded so far that he could barely see its murky surface in the shadows. At sixty-two years old, the high priest had served the rain god Chaac through three kings' reigns, but never had he witnessed such stubborn drought."The gods are angry," whispered Akbal, his young apprentice, as he placed a intricately carved obsidian blade beside the jade. "The rains should have come two months ago."Itzamnaaj nodded grimly. Above them, the great pyramid of Temple IV rose like a stone mountain toward the cloudless sky, its summit disappearing into the forest canopy. Once, the temple's height had seemed to guarantee their connection to the celestial realm. Now it felt like a desperate plea cast into an indifferent void.The sound of conch shells echoed across the plaza, calling the people to witness the ceremony. Itzamnaaj watched as they emerged from between the towering structures—farmers whose terraced fields lay cracked and barren, craftsmen whose workshops had fallen silent for lack of trade, nobles whose painted cotton garments could no longer hide their hollow cheeks. Even King Jasaw Chan K'inich III, descendant of the great conqueror, moved with the careful steps of a man conserving his strength."Tell me again about the old days, grandfather," said Itzel, Itzamnaaj's granddaughter, as she helped him to his feet. At fifteen, she should have been preparing for marriage to a young lord from Caracol or Calakmul. Instead, she spent her days helping tend the dwindling temple gardens and learning the sacred calendar from her grandfather."The old days," Itzamnaaj repeated softly, his eyes growing distant. "When I was your age, child, the rains came like clockwork. The farmers' almanacs never failed. We could feed sixty thousand souls in this city alone, with surplus to trade with our neighbors. Our armies were mighty, our monuments magnificent. We carved our victories into stone and reached toward the stars."He gestured toward the stelae that lined the plaza, their hieroglyphic inscriptions recording the great deeds of kings past. "Your great-grandfather served under Jasaw Chan K'inich I, who defeated mighty Calakmul and brought glory to Tikal. The tribute flowed like rivers—cacao from the south, obsidian from the highlands, jade from the Motagua valley. We built temples that touched the heavens and predicted eclipses with perfect precision."Itzel had heard these stories countless times, but today they felt different—less like history and more like legends from another world. She looked around at the plaza, where weeds pushed through cracks in the carefully fitted stones, and wondered if her grandfather's memories were real or merely dreams painted on the walls of his mind.The ceremony began as the sun reached its zenith. King Jasaw Chan K'inich III, resplendent in his jade-studded headdress and jaguar-skin cloak, took his place at the altar. Despite his royal finery, Itzamnaaj could see the weight of responsibility crushing down on the young king's shoulders. Three successive harvest failures had emptied the royal granaries and turned allies into enemies. Refugees from the countryside swelled the city beyond its capacity to feed them, while neighboring cities eyed Tikal's weakened state like hungry jaguars.The bloodletting ritual began. The king pierced his tongue with a stingray spine, letting his sacred blood drip onto bark paper that would be burned as an offering to the gods. His queen followed, drawing a thorned rope through her tongue in the ancient manner. The smoke from the burning blood-soaked paper rose straight up in the still air—another troubling sign, for the shamans taught that swirling smoke carried prayers to the gods, while straight smoke suggested divine indifference."Great Chaac, lord of the rains," Itzamnaaj chanted, his voice carrying across the silent plaza, "we offer you our most precious gifts. We give you jade from the sacred mountains, obsidian sharper than lightning, and the blood of your earthly representatives. Send us the rains that give life to the corn, that fill our cenotes, that restore the green world you created for your people."The crowd joined in the ancient prayers, their voices rising in desperate harmony. Children who had never seen their fields green, elders who remembered abundance, all united in their plea to the silent sky. But as hours passed and the sun began its descent toward the western horizon, no clouds gathered. No thunder announced Chaac's approach. The ceremony that had never failed their ancestors met only echoing silence.As twilight fell, the crowd began to disperse with heavy hearts. Itzamnaaj remained by the cenote, staring into its depths. Itzel sat beside him, her young face etched with worry."What will happen to us, grandfather?"The old priest was quiet for a long moment. In the distance, he could hear the sounds of the city—but they were different now. Fewer voices, less laughter, more arguments over dwindling resources. The great marketplace that once bustled with traders from across Mesoamerica now hosted only a handful of desperate sellers hawking their family heirlooms for handfuls of corn."I have been studying the calendar wheels," he said finally. "The patterns our ancestors discovered, the great cycles that govern all things. We are approaching the end of a b'ak'tun, a period of great change. Perhaps this drought is not just weather, but the closing of an age.""But surely the gods will relent? Surely the rains will return?"Itzamnaaj pulled out a bark-paper codex from his priestly bundle, its pages covered with intricate calculations and astronomical observations. "Three generations ago, our astronomers began noticing changes. The rains became less predictable. The dry seasons grew longer. At first, we thought it was temporary—the gods testing our faith. But the pattern has continued, and now..."He pointed to a series of dots and bars that recorded rainfall measurements going back two centuries. Even in the dim starlight, the declining pattern was clear."The earth itself is changing, child. The great forest that gives us life is struggling. Too many cities, too many people clearing land for farms, too much war disrupting the natural order. We have grown mighty, but perhaps too mighty for the world to sustain us."In the months that followed, Itzamnaaj's fears proved prophetic. King Jasaw Chan K'inich III died of a fever, weakened by hunger and stress. His heir was a child, and the regency council could not agree on how to address the crisis. Rival factions formed, each blaming the others for the gods' displeasure. Some called for more human sacrifices to appease Chaac, others for abandoning the city to seek new lands.The great construction projects that had employed thousands of workers ground to a halt. The scribes who had maintained the temple libraries began to scatter, taking their knowledge to smaller cities that might still have food to offer. Trade networks that had connected the Maya world for centuries began to collapse as cities turned inward, hoarding their dwindling resources.Itzamnaaj continued his daily rituals, tending the sacred fires and maintaining the calendar counts, even as his assistants drifted away one by one. Itzel remained by his side, learning the ancient wisdom that might soon have no one left to preserve it."Will anyone remember us?" she asked one evening as they sat atop Temple IV, looking out over the forest canopy where the lights of smaller settlements flickered like dying stars.Her grandfather smiled sadly. "The stones will remember, child. Our monuments will stand, our inscriptions will endure. Someday, perhaps, other people will come and wonder at what we built. They will puzzle over our calendar and marvel at our knowledge of the stars. But they may never know the sound of children playing in these plazas, or the taste of fresh cacao on festival days, or the joy we felt when the rains finally came."Below them, the great city of Tikal settled into another restless night, its population scattered among structures built for multitudes. The cenotes continued their slow retreat, the fields remained barren, and the forest began its patient work of reclaiming the monuments that had once defied its dominance.The Maya did not disappear—they adapted, survived, and endured in smaller communities throughout the region. But the great age of the Classic Maya, with its magnificent cities and complex civilization, was drawing to a close. The last rain ceremony had been performed, and the gods, it seemed, had other plans for the green world they had created.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/mayan-collapse.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/mayan-collapse.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[medieval-serfs-and-nobles]]></title><description><![CDATA[The frost-laden air bit at Wulfric's weathered hands as he guided his wooden plow through the stubborn soil of the demesne fields. The ox strained against its harness, its breath forming clouds in the cold morning air. Behind him, his eldest son Thomas scattered winter wheat seeds while his younger children followed, covering the precious grain with soil using wooden rakes. The work was difficult, but it could not wait. Lord Geoffrey had made it clear that the demesne planting must be completed before the serfs could turn to their own strips of land."Father, riders coming," Thomas called out, pointing toward the road that wound down from the castle perched on the hill overlooking the manor.Wulfric squinted against the weak November sun. Indeed, several mounted figures were approaching—Lord Geoffrey himself, his steward Edwin, and two men-at-arms. His lordship rarely ventured into the fields except to hunt or to make a point. Wulfric suspected the latter today."Keep working," he instructed his children quietly. "Eyes down when they pass."Lord Geoffrey reined his destrier to a halt near where Wulfric worked. The massive warhorse, worth more than everything Wulfric's family would earn in a lifetime, snorted and pawed at the ground impatiently."Steward, remind me whose responsibility it was to repair the mill wheel before winter?" Lord Geoffrey asked, though it was clear he already knew the answer.Edwin, a free man who managed the estate but was not of noble birth, consulted a small parchment roll. "The families from the north fields, my lord. Five days' labor each.""And why, then, does the miller tell me the work remains half-finished?" Lord Geoffrey's voice carried across the field.Wulfric kept his eyes fixed on the soil before him, but he knew the question was directed at him. As the reeve—a position elected by his fellow serfs but approved by the lord—it fell to him to organize such labor obligations."My lord," Wulfric said, stopping his plow and bowing his head, "we began the work as instructed, but then came your order to harvest the demesne vineyard before the rains. We couldn't—""Couldn't?" Lord Geoffrey interrupted. "The manor court will determine if 'couldn't' is sufficient excuse. Until then, a fine of two shillings from each household that failed in their duty."Two shillings. Wulfric felt his stomach tighten. It might as well have been twenty pounds for all his ability to pay it. The family had barely scraped together enough to pay the Martinmas tax last week."The mill must operate at full capacity," Lord Geoffrey continued. "The grain from three manors will be ground there this winter.""Yes, my lord," Wulfric replied, keeping his voice steady. "We will complete it immediately.""See that you do." Lord Geoffrey turned his horse. "Steward, make note of which families have yet to deliver their full measure of chickens for the lady's kitchen.""Already recorded, my lord," Edwin replied, tapping his parchment.As they rode away, Wulfric's eldest daughter Agnes approached from where she had been watching the children."Father, how will we pay?" she whispered, concern etched across her face."We will find a way," he answered, though he had no solution to offer. "Return to the cottage. Your mother needs help preparing for the manor court."The great hall of the castle was filled with the manor's inhabitants. Wulfric stood with his family and the other unfree tenants on one side, while the few free tenants—mostly specialized craftsmen and yeoman farmers—stood on the other. At the front, Lord Geoffrey sat in his ornately carved chair, his lady beside him in a smaller seat. Before them, Edwin the steward prepared to conduct the court's business.Emma, Wulfric's wife, clutched their youngest child to her chest. She had spent the morning preparing their cottage for the important visitor expected later—the lady of the manor would inspect their home as part of her seasonal rounds."The court is in session," Edwin announced. "First matter: the mill repairs."Over the next hour, various disputes and infractions were addressed. A fine for brewing ale without permission. A dispute over boundaries between strips in the common fields. A marriage agreement between two serf families, requiring the lord's approval and the customary payment.When Wulfric's name was called regarding the mill repairs, he stepped forward."The fine stands at two shillings," Edwin declared. "To be paid by Christmastide.""My lord," Wulfric said, addressing Geoffrey directly, which was his right as reeve, "I ask mercy in this matter. We could not complete the mill because we were called to the vineyard. We cannot serve in two places at once."Lord Geoffrey studied him for a moment. "The fine is reduced to one shilling, in recognition of your service as reeve. But the mill must be operational within the week."It was not the outcome Wulfric had hoped for, but it was better than nothing. He bowed his head. "Thank you, my lord."As he stepped back, the steward called the next case. "Edith, daughter of John the Smith, seeks permission to marry Walter of Thornfield Manor."A young woman stepped forward nervously. Wulfric knew her family well—her father was one of the few skilled craftsmen who held a somewhat privileged position among the serfs."This requires merchet payment," Edwin stated, referring to the fee serfs must pay for the right to marry. "And as she would leave our manor, Lord Geoffrey's permission is required."Geoffrey leaned forward. "What does Lord Humphrey of Thornfield offer for this girl?""Three silver pennies, my lord, and a promise that her firstborn son will return to your manor when of age."Geoffrey shook his head. "Not enough. The girl is young and strong. Tell Lord Humphrey five pennies, and both her first son and daughter return to us."Edith's face fell, but she said nothing. She had no more say in the matter than the oxen had in their yokes.As the court continued, Lady Matilda rose quietly and left through a side door. Emma nudged Wulfric. "She goes to inspect the cottages now," she whispered. "I must return."Emma hurried back to their cottage, a simple one-room structure with walls of wattle and daub and a thatched roof that needed repair. She had swept the dirt floor, hung fresh herbs to mask the usual smells, and cleared the space as best she could.When Lady Matilda arrived, accompanied by her personal maid, Emma curtsied deeply."Rise," Lady Matilda said, her voice softer than her husband's but no less authoritative. She surveyed the cottage, noting the condition of the roof, the stores of food, the small loom where Emma wove cloth."Your daughter, Agnes—she has skill with the loom," Lady Matilda stated. It wasn't a question."Yes, my lady. She has a good eye for the weaving.""She will come to the castle tomorrow. We need help preparing cloth for winter garments."Emma hesitated. Agnes's work was essential to their own household, especially with the coming winter. But one did not refuse the lady of the manor."Of course, my lady. She will be honored."Lady Matilda's gaze fell on the small barrel in the corner. "Is that honey?""Yes, my lady. From our two hives.""Two? The manor roll lists your family with one hive."Emma's heart sank. The second hive had been a gift from her brother who lived in the next village, but all production from the manor's resources belonged primarily to the lord. They had hoped to keep it unrecorded."The second is recent, my lady. A swarm that we captured in late summer."Lady Matilda nodded to her maid, who made a note. "The steward will adjust your dues accordingly." She paused, then added, "However, your roof needs repair before winter. I will send the thatcher tomorrow, and you will provide him food while he works."Emma curtsied again. "Thank you, my lady."It was the way of things—simultaneous burden and mercy. The honey production would now be taxed, but the roof would be repaired. The daughter's labor would be taken, but she might learn skills and connections that could prove valuable.The following Sunday, after Mass in the small stone church that served the manor, Wulfric and Emma lingered in the churchyard with other villagers. This was one of the few times they could speak freely without immediately returning to labor.Father Thomas, the parish priest, emerged from the church. Though appointed by Lord Geoffrey, he served as an intermediary between the classes, often advocating for the serfs while reminding them of their Christian duty to serve."Wulfric," the priest called, "a word."Wulfric approached, bowing his head respectfully. Father Thomas was the only person on the manor who could read and write, apart from Lord Geoffrey and perhaps the steward. This made him both valuable and powerful."I spoke with Lord Geoffrey about the mill fine," Father Thomas said quietly. "He has agreed that you may pay half now and half at Easter, when you have more to spare."Relief washed over Wulfric. "Thank you, Father. That will help greatly.""There is more," the priest continued. "The bishop visits next month. Lord Geoffrey wishes to appear generous before his superior. He will forgive one day of labor service per household if the church is thoroughly cleaned and decorated."This was valuable information. A day free from labor service meant a day to work their own strips of land or perhaps earn a few pennies in the nearby town, where Wulfric occasionally found work during slack periods.As December arrived, the rhythm of manor life shifted. Work on the fields slowed, though never entirely ceased. Instead, the focus turned to indoor tasks—repairing tools, spinning wool, preserving the last of the autumn slaughter, and paying the winter dues.In the small cottage, the family gathered around the central hearth where a meager fire provided both warmth and light. Agnes had returned from the castle with stories of the grand stone rooms, the tapestries that hung on walls to keep out drafts, and the quantity of food prepared in the kitchens."Lady Matilda has a gown lined with fur," she reported, eyes wide. "And they eat white bread every day.""And what of your work?" Emma asked, spinning wool as they talked."I helped prepare the cloth for new tunics for the household knights," Agnes said proudly. "Lady Matilda said my stitching was neat. She gave me this."Agnes produced a small silver pin—a token of almost no value to the lady but a treasure to a serf girl who owned nothing but her clothing and perhaps a wooden cup."That was generous," Wulfric acknowledged. "Did you thank her properly?""Yes, Father. And she said I should return after Epiphany to help with more sewing."Thomas, who had been watching from his place by the door, spoke up. "Father, is it true we cannot leave the manor without Lord Geoffrey's permission?"Wulfric exchanged a glance with Emma. Their children were growing old enough to understand the nature of their bondage."That is our lot," Wulfric explained carefully. "We are bound to this land. We farm our strips, we work the lord's demesne, we pay our dues, and in return, we have his protection.""But Walter the miller's son left last spring," Thomas persisted. "He now works in York, they say.""He ran," Wulfric replied softly. "If caught, he would be brought back and punished. And his family here would suffer for it.""Some do escape to the towns," Emma added, her voice barely above a whisper. "If they live unclaimed for a year and a day, they can become free. But it is a dangerous path.""Could we not buy our freedom?" Thomas asked. "Like Peter the Shepherd did last year?"Wulfric sighed. "Peter had saved for twenty years to pay the manumission price. And he had no children to consider in the payment."The question hung in the air. Freedom was not impossible—a few achieved it each generation—but the obstacles were immense. The lord had little incentive to free productive workers, and the price was typically far beyond what a serf family could save.The following day, Wulfric was summoned to the castle. As reeve, he was responsible for organizing the serfs' labor and ensuring quotas were met. He was also the voice of the villagers when issues arose, a dangerous position that balanced between advocating for his people and satisfying the lord's demands.In the steward's room, a small chamber off the great hall, Edwin reviewed the winter work schedule."The northern forest needs clearing for new planting," Edwin informed him. "Ten men for two weeks.""The timing is difficult," Wulfric replied cautiously. "Many are already assigned to the mill repairs, and the women are needed for the flax processing.""Nevertheless, it must be done," Edwin replied firmly. "But," he added, lowering his voice slightly, "Lord Geoffrey recognizes your household's diligence. If you organize this efficiently, he will consider reducing your Martinmas dues next year."It was a significant concession. The Martinmas payment was one of the heaviest burdens of the year. Wulfric nodded, understanding the unspoken exchange. His cooperation now would be remembered later."There is another matter," Edwin continued. "Lord Geoffrey wishes to expand the vineyard on the south slope. Some of the common grazing land will be enclosed for this purpose."Wulfric felt a surge of concern. The common land was vital for the villagers' livestock. "How many acres?" he asked."Five," Edwin replied, making a note on his parchment. "The reallocation will be announced at the next court."Wulfric knew there would be anger and distress among the villagers, but he also knew protest would be futile. Lord Geoffrey's right to manage the land was absolute, supported by both law and custom. The best he could hope for was to negotiate some small concession."The villagers will need alternative grazing," he ventured.Edwin glanced up. "That is not my concern.""The milk production will fall," Wulfric pressed. "And with it, the cheese dues owed to the castle."This practical observation caught Edwin's attention. The steward's own position depended on maintaining the manor's productivity."I will mention it to his lordship," Edwin conceded. "Perhaps the woodland edge could be opened for limited grazing."It was a small victory, but Wulfric knew better than to press further. As he turned to leave, Edwin called after him."One more thing. Lady Matilda requests your daughter Agnes's service for the entire Epiphany season, not just a few days. She will sleep in the castle and receive food."Wulfric paused. This was both opportunity and loss—Agnes would be fed from the lord's kitchen during the leanest months of winter, but her labor would be lost to their household during a critical time."As her ladyship wishes," he replied, keeping his tone neutral.Spring arrived with its endless labor—plowing, sowing, lambing, repairing winter damage. But it also brought the Easter court, where the balance of power occasionally shifted slightly in the serfs' favor. With planting season upon them, Lord Geoffrey could not afford excessive disruption to the labor force.In the great hall, Wulfric stood with several other senior villagers, prepared to present their petition regarding the lost grazing land. They had carefully pooled their meager resources to offer a special payment in exchange for access to the woodland edge Edwin had mentioned months earlier.When their turn came, Wulfric spoke with careful deference."My lord, regarding the new vineyard enclosure, we offer six shillings annually for grazing rights along the eastern woodland."Lord Geoffrey raised an eyebrow at the substantial offer. "The woodland hunting would be disturbed by your animals.""Only the edge, my lord, and not during the fall hunt," Wulfric clarified. "And we would maintain the boundary ditches at our own expense."Lord Geoffrey considered this, then nodded to Edwin. "Make it eight shillings, with the first payment due at Midsummer, and we are agreed."It was more than they had hoped to pay, but less than they had feared. The villagers would struggle to collect the payment, but their animals would not starve. The delicate negotiation had yielded a tolerable outcome.As the court proceeded, Agnes entered the hall with Lady Matilda and her ladies. Three months in the castle had changed her subtly—her posture was straighter, her manner more confident. She carried herself differently, though she still wore the simple clothing of a serf.Lady Matilda addressed her husband but spoke loudly enough for the court to hear. "Agnes has shown exceptional skill with fine needlework. I wish to retain her services permanently in my household."Lord Geoffrey nodded. "Wulfric," he called, "your daughter will serve in the castle henceforth. Your household will be compensated with one less day of weekly labor service."It was presented as a decision already made, though in truth, Wulfric and Emma had no legal right to refuse. Agnes would now exist between two worlds—born a serf but living among the nobility, never truly belonging to either.Later, as the family walked back to their cottage, Emma voiced what they all felt. "She will have a better life. Regular meals, a roof that doesn't leak, perhaps even learning to read a little from the castle chaplain.""And fewer chances to marry and have her own household," Wulfric added quietly. "She will serve others all her days.""As do we all," Emma replied, gesturing to the fields around them where generations of their ancestors had toiled. "Each in our place."As summer solstice approached, word reached the manor of events in the wider kingdom. Lord Geoffrey had been summoned by King John, who faced a rebellion from his barons. Rumors spoke of a great charter the king had been forced to seal, limiting some of his powers.In the fields, such distant politics seemed irrelevant. The crops grew or failed based on weather and labor, not royal decrees. The daily rhythm of manor life continued—sunrise to sunset in the fields, Sunday at church, occasional visits to the nearby market town with the lord's permission.Yet when Lord Geoffrey returned from his journey, subtle changes began to appear. The manor court procedures became more standardized. When judgments were rendered, Edwin now referenced "the custom of the manor" rather than simply "the lord's will." Records were kept more meticulously.During the autumn harvest, as Wulfric directed the collection of the lord's portion from the common fields, he reflected on the nature of their existence. Their lives remained circumscribed by boundaries both physical and social—the manor's edge, their status as serfs, the lord's authority. Yet within those boundaries, there existed a complex web of mutual obligations, carefully negotiated spaces, and occasional opportunities.His son Thomas would likely become reeve after him, continuing the family's precarious position between lord and villagers. Agnes would serve in the castle, perhaps eventually becoming a valued lady's maid. The younger children would work the same strips of land, bound by the same obligations and customs.The lord held power, but even he was constrained by tradition, practicality, and now, it seemed, by royal charter. The relationship between lord and serf, while profoundly unequal, was not simply one of unlimited power and absolute submission. It was a system of mutual dependence—the lord needing labor and production, the serfs needing protection and access to land—codified in custom and enforced through a combination of legal authority, social pressure, and practical necessity.As the harvest wagons rolled toward the manor, Wulfric watched Lord Geoffrey observing from horseback. Their eyes met briefly across the distance—noble and serf, two men bound together in a system neither had created but both perpetuated, each playing their assigned role in the tapestry of medieval life.Between them lay the land they both depended upon but experienced entirely differently—for one, a source of wealth, status, and power; for the other, a source of sustenance, identity, and obligation. This land, and their relationship to it and each other, would define their lives and those of their descendants for generations to come.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/medieval-serfs-and-nobles.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/history/narratives/medieval-serfs-and-nobles.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[american-gov-101]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a crash-course style book on the structure and origins of the US Gov.

communism I want them to create a map and timeline using QGIS that has digitized data to show what we studied and when it happened. I need to have the power to limit queries to only data within certain date ranges, but otherwise this will be a great way to keep track of the world's history as we learn it.
Figure out how to use QGIS or other mapping tool to do a time-dependent map for history <a href=".?query=tag:todo/school" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#todo/school">#todo/school</a>

Territory is polygon data
Routes are lines
Battlefronts are lines
Events happen at points, or polygons if they have large extent
heatmap/raster data can be used for things like death tolls from plague and war
Text data can hold links that point to documents, either stuff they write or resources they reference.

Identify where on the map and when in time we're working
Mark the lesson region on the map and timeline as a polygon or point, depending on what it is

Computer Numeric Control
A machine that has some number of actuators that move things around or operate tools
Each actuator is called an "axis", and the machine's complexity can be summarized by the number of axes it has (3-axis mill, 5-axis mill, 6-axis arm)
The tools can be a huge assortment of things: Pens
laser
plasma torch
rotating cutter
plastic extruder
air pump
Anything that is turned on or adjusted while the machine operates The basic idea is this: Instead of positioning an controlling a tool manually, build a machine that can do it precisely then write a program to actually make the movements and operations happen Most CNC machines are programmed using a low-level language called g-code. <a data-href="intro-to-cnc" href="projects/school-25-26/engineering/intro-to-cnc.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">intro-to-cnc</a>
Homing When the machine is powered on, it generally doesn't know what the state of its various axes are.
Homing involves moving each axis until a known position is found and then setting that as "home"
All motions the machine does are now relative to that home position
Sometimes this is a fixed location, sometimes you set this as the user. Depending on the g-code you're running, there may be a location on the part that you're using has home because it's easy to find with precision. Using part-based home is especially useful for multi-setup operations, where you have to stop the machine and reposition the part. With an absolute home, it would be much harder to get the part mounted in exactly the right place. Part-based homing lets you move the tool head to the right spot and say "start from here." This is a lot like assembly language for a CPU - it tells the machine to do an extremely limited operation with well-known, exact requirements Most of the operations are single-axis motions
operations can include more complex pre-programmed sequences, like homing ]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/engineering/lessons/engr-01-what-is-cnc.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-25-26/engineering/lessons/engr-01-what-is-cnc.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 21:37:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[engineering-2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[Big ideas:

What's the important concept here?
Cells "burn" food by gradually oxidizing it to release protons
The protons are used to drive cellular machinery that synthesizes ATP
ATP is like a rechargeable battery
The cell starts with glucose, cuts it into a few pieces, then that becomes pyruvate. That part of the process yields 2 ATP and 2 NADH Pyruvate is then oxidized and enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria
The citric acid cycle yields one ATP per turn, going through several changes until it winds up with citric acid again Multi column
Topics for anki deck 9.1 Catabolic pathways yield energy by oxidizing organic fuels p. 165 9.2 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate 9.3 After pyruvate is oxidized, the citric acid cycle completes the energy-yielding oxidation of organic molecules 9.4 During oxidative phosphorylation, chemiosmosis couples electron transport to ATP synthesis 9.5 Fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable cells to produce ATP without the use of oxygen 9.6 Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways fermentation aerobic respiration cellular respiration redox reactions (oxidation-reduction) oxidation - loss of electrons to a substance reduction - addition of electrons to a substance energy-yielding foods (carbohydrates and fats) NAD+ and NADH - enzymes to help gradually oxidize foods by removing electrons one at a time
electron transport chain - harvest energy along the way as hydrogen reacts with oxygen

Focus on the big picture in this chapter. There is a lot of jargon and complex language, but the main idea is this:The cell uses the free energy available from hydrolyzing ATP into ADP to drive chemical reactions that are otherwise not able to happen by themselves (like building complex molecules from simple parts). For reactions that would spontaneously occur except for their high activation energy, the cell has thousands of enzymes that grab the reactants and put them together properly so that the reaction can happen. With these two processes active, the cell can locally reverse the trend of increasing entropy by consuming energy from outside and using it to build order on the inside.Multi column

Lesson Content Solving systems of equations
Solve one equation for one variable, then substitute the result into the next equation
Why does that work? It constrains the solutions to only ones that work with both equations. Guided Practice Jackie and Rachel both worked during last summer and made $960.00 each. Rachel worked 16 hours more than Jackie, but Rachel earned $2.00 less per hour. How many hours did Jackie work?

Draw the representation of the object at several times during the interval you're analyzing. Usually, you just need to draw a dot to represent it.
Draw position-change vectors; arrows that go from a dot to the next dot in the sequence. These represent the change in position of the object from one frame to the next.
Draw the velocity-change vectors; put a position-change vector () tail-to-tail with the next position-change vector (), then draw another vector that connects the point of to the point of . Position-change vectors are velocity vectors
Velocity-change vectors are acceleration vectors

Start with basics. Eat before you go. Most events are light on food and heavy on overstimulation. Being full helps you stay present, not preoccupied.Add one small item to what you're wearing that gives others something to comment on. It’s called a “Whatzit.” A pin, a vintage shirt, a random book in your hand. People need an excuse to start a conversation—give them one.Scan the news for 2 minutes. You don’t need to be a genius, but it keeps you from blanking out when someone says, “Did you see what happened today?” This isn’t about having talking points. It’s about removing friction.Lastly, go over the Six-Point Party Checklist: Who’s going? When do you want to arrive? What’s the vibe? Why are you attending? Where is it exactly? How are you getting back? These simple questions give structure to an evening that often feels like chaos.The most overlooked part of networking is the first 5 seconds. People scan you quickly and assign a story. You can shape that story.Stand still in the doorway. Look around. Not like you're lost—like you're assessing. This pause signals confidence. Then pick a group that feels open and approach. No rush.Keep your body open. Wrists visible, arms uncrossed. Your posture is your pitch. Shoulders back, chin level.Make eye contact before you smile. Let there be a beat. Then let the smile arrive slowly. This “delayed warmth” makes your smile feel specific, not generic. It’s subtle, but people feel the difference.Most people hate starting conversations because they overthink the words. The truth is, words are secondary. Your tone, posture, and energy do most of the work.Start with: “How do you spend most of your time?” Not “What do you do?” It opens people up beyond job titles.Listen for what lights them up. Echo a few of their words back to them. If someone says they’re working on solar hardware, ask, “Solar hardware?”—then pause. It gives them space to explain, and shows you’re actually listening.When they’re done, don’t jump in with your story. Wait. Let the silence breathe. If you share something in common, wait a beat before you say it. The delay makes it feel like insight, not interruption.Keep track of the small things. Their dog’s name. The town they just moved from. That one thing they said in passing.If you’re in a group, use their own story to spotlight them. Say something like, “You have to tell everyone about that glacier trip.” That line alone can shift how they remember you. It shows that you’re paying attention—and willing to share the room.If the conversation stalls, don’t panic. Repeat the last few words they said with a slight upward tone. It’s called “parroting,” and it gently invites them to keep going without forcing anything.If someone says, “Work’s been kind of chaotic lately,” you can just respond with, “Chaotic lately?”—and let them take it from there.Hosts are often moving fast. Don’t waste their time with “Great party.” Say something more vivid. “The lighting is perfect.” “Everyone feels relaxed.” It anchors your presence with detail.Offer to help with something small—refill ice, carry extra plates. Tiny acts give you visibility without performance.Don’t disappear. Say goodbye with intention. Use an uncommon adjective: “Had a remarkable time.” “Such a thoughtful gathering.” That small twist makes you stick.If you connected with someone, follow up within 24 hours. Share an article, a meme, a line that ties back to your conversation. This isn’t networking. It’s reinforcement.Write down what you remember—glacier, dog name, their startup idea. Those notes are your memory system for real relationships.Three weeks later, check in. It’s not needy. It’s respectful. Most people forget. You didn’t. That matters.What i have learnt is that you don’t need to work the room or become someone you’re not. Most of the time, it’s enough to show up with confidence, listen well, and leave one real moment behind. That’s the part people remember anyway.]]></description><link>projects/school-25-26/life-skills/socializing.html</link><guid

Overall, this is a good essay. You need to work on transitions and on developing your own thoughts about an idea rather than relying on over-quotation. For example, in the paragraph about funny content, you might explain why you think that's a good thing and how it helps you understand and remember the things about the book that felt important. The biggest hit you took was on language and style, because you still need to work on catching punctuation and usage errors. We'll find some practice for that and see what we can do. Overall, good job.
<br>This book report is about The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett. Sir Terence David John Pratchett OBE (28 April 1948 – 12 March 2015) was an English author, humorist, and satirist, best known for the Discworld series of 41 comic fantasy novels published between 1983 and 2015, and for the comedy novel Good Omens (1990), which he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman. Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, The Color of Magic, was published in 1983, after which Pratchett wrote an average of two books a year. The final Discworld novel, The Shepherd's Crown, was published in August 2015, five months after his death. <a data-footref="fn1" href="#fn-1-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> Terry Pratchett was knighted for his literary prowess and what he offered through his literature. The Wee Free Men is a fun book about a young girl who's <a data-footref="fn2" href="#fn-2-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> name is Tiffany, and who saved her younger brother from the Queen of the fey because nobody else would. In the story she traveled through the fey world of dreams and nightmares to find her little brother, and fought all kinds of nightmares and enemies on her way through.
This book has important topics in it such as "do the work" and stereotyping. Even though he has such important life lessons in his book he has a fun and engaging writing style and has funny language.<br>Some of the funny things about the book are things such as the names "No-As-Big-As-A-Medium-Sized-Jock-But-Bigger-Than-A-Wee-Jock-Jock" and "Rob Anybody". He also uses words and phrases based off of <a data-footref="fn3" href="#fn-3-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a> Pictish language such as "Ach! Crivens!" or “Them as can do has to do for them as can't. And someone has to speak up for them as has no voices.” and<a data-footref="capitalize" href="#fn-4-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a> “Whut's the plan, Rob?" said one of them.
"Okay, lads, this is what we'll do. As soon as we see somethin', we'll attack it. Right?"
This caused a cheer.<br>
"Ach, 'tis a good plan," said Daft Wullie”. It wasn't just the pictsies that had interesting speech, he also throws in fun little phrases like “I can see we're going to get along like a house on fire," said Miss Tick. "There may be no survivors.” and “Never cross a woman with a star on a stick, young lady. They've got a mean streak.” He has a very fun, upbeat writing style that still tells a good story. He uses long interesting words in very good places such as susurrus. Even though he has such a fun upbeat writing style he still conveys important life lessons. <a data-footref="toomuchquoted" href="#fn-5-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[5]</a>The biggest life lesson he writes about is "do the work". A very good quote from the book about it is “Witches are naturally nosy,” said Miss Tick, standing up. “Well, I must go. I hope we shall meet again. I will give you some free advice, though.”
“Will it cost me anything?”
“What? I just said it was free!” said Miss Tick.
“Yes, but my father said that free advice often turns out to be expensive,” said Tiffany.
Miss Tick sniffed. “You could say this advice is priceless,” she said, “Are you listening?”
“Yes,” said Tiffany.
“Good. Now...if you trust in yourself...”
“Yes?”
“...and believe in your dreams...”
“Yes?”
“...and follow your star...” Miss Tick went on.
“Yes?”
“...you’ll still be beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy. Goodbye.”
― Terry Pratchett, The Wee Free Men<br>
He talks about if you work towards your dream you can achieve it but if you sit around wishing you will never get there. This has effected <a data-footref="affecteffect" href="#fn-6-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[6]</a> me in different ways. I thought about learning how to crochet and make stuff to sell and it got me nowhere, but then I went and just bought a kit to learn and I started learning to crochet and make things to sell. It isn't always hard to do the things that you want to do you just need to work on them until you get there. He conveys more than one life lesson that just one though. He also talks about stereotypes.<br>He has many opinions on stereotypes hidden in his writing. Stereotyping effected <a data-footref="affecteffect" href="#fn-6-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[6-1]</a> Tiffany in multiple different ways, such as, since she was young she was "dumb" and "didn't know how to do anything".<a data-footref="punctuate_inside" href="#fn-7-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[7]</a> In the book all she can do is make cheese and go to the market because nobody thinks she is smart enough to do anything else. He has more than just one stereotype in his book beside age<a data-footref="reword" href="#fn-8-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[8]</a>. He also has a gender stereotype. At the end of the first book nobody would believe that Tiffany did anything to help herself and she just cowered and let other people do everything for her because she was a girl. I have had bad experiences with stereotyping, such as,<a data-footref="reword" href="#fn-8-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[8-1]</a> I am a good cook but most adults don't trust kids to cook anything good. Later in the book Tiffany found a boy who had gone missing a few weeks ago while she was trying to rescue her little brother. Everyone though that the boy she found had saved her and she just cowered in fear behind him, but instead it was the other way around, She <a data-footref="capitalize" href="#fn-4-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4-1]</a> had a weapon.<br>I loved this book, some of my favorite things about it were his writing style, it was funny, engaging, and made a very good story, some of the phrases in the book made me die laughing.

I think that he has many good life lessons in the book. I think that all in all this was one of the best books I have read and I would highly recommend to read it if you haven't already.

This is a very good essay, well done. My only comments are around the development and organization - it feels like this essay is mostly about stereotypes and the other two big ideas were added in to fill out the word count. I'd like to see a more even coverage of the ideas.
Throughout The Wee Free Men, Terry Pratchett wrote about stereotypes and the harm they can cause, as well as advice on the most fulfilling way to live your life. He wrote about what the women that lived in the Chalk (a place named for its chalky turf) were expected to do, such as learning to write and getting married. He also wrote about how the children of the Chalk were expected to behave.&nbsp;
But the point he especially focused on was about the harm that believing in stories without evidence can do. The main character, Tiffany, never believed the stories about the wicked old witch and the beautiful princess. Tiffany was intelligent and clever, unlike most children in the Chalk, and she didn't want to grow up just to get married like everyone else expected of her. She wanted to change the minds of the people in the Chalk and show them their errors.&nbsp;Early in the book, there was a story about an old woman called Mrs. Snapperly who was burned out of her home because she looked like a witch and had a black cat. Tiffany had never agreed with the actions the people in the Chalk took because of the false stories they'd believed, and she wanted to be a witch so she could prove those stories wrong. There was a passage towards the beginning of the book where Pratchett explained the reasons for Tiffany's disbelief in the storybooks and tales:"And all the stories had, somewhere, the witch. The wicked old witch.
And Tiffany had thought, Where's the evidence?
The stories never said why she was wicked." --Page 27, The Wee Free Men, by Terry Pratchett.<br>By making Tiffany yearn for more evidence to back up the information in the stories, Pratchett explained to the readers why Tiffany<a data-footref="repetitive" href="#fn-1-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> was skeptical about the stereotypes surrounding witches and fairies.Pratchett proved the stereotypes wrong near the end of the book when he introduced a character called the Queen. The Queen was a beautiful elf, but she stole children and used dreams and nightmares to trap them in her world forever. She stole Tiffany's brother, Wentworth, which led to Tiffany crossing into the Queen's world and utilizing the dreamscape to get him back. During the rescue, she found the baron's son in the Queen's world, but he believed the stories about witches and tried to attack Tiffany. He thought the Queen was good because she was beautiful, and he was confused about Tiffany being a witch because she wasn't old and ugly like in the tales. However, by the end of the book, she managed to convince him that the stories he'd heard were wrong and not everything was as it was told.There are several key takeaways from the Wee Free Men, but I think the most important one of them all is don't fall victim to stereotypes. Throughout the book, we meet characters who never questioned what they were told and never thought about it for themselves, and because of that, they did terrible things. Pratchett told us to use our minds to find the flaws in the logic and look for the answers ourselves.&nbsp;<br>
The second takeaway that arose near the end of the book was don't do good things for a reward; do them because they're right. Tiffany rescued the baron's son and her own brother, but because the baron's son was a boy and he was older than Tiffany, everyone thought it was him<a data-footref="he_him" href="#fn-2-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> who did the rescuing, and they wouldn't believe otherwise even when he tried to explain what had really<a data-footref="noitalic" href="#fn-3-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a> happened. Though it bugged Tiffany at first, in the end she was okay with it because she knew she had done the right thing and she didn't need recognition to know that. This is very important to remember. If it's not of the utmost importance, just let it go.&nbsp;<br>
The final important subject he talked about is<a data-footref="reword" href="#fn-4-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a> you have to do the work. You can't change the way things are going just by wishing for them to change; you have to work if you want to get anywhere in life. Sitting by and passively wishing that things were different just means that the people who are working to actually change things—whether you agree with it or not—are going to get what they want because they did the work. This was explained clearly in the beginning of the book:"If you trust in yourself. . .and believe in your dreams. . .and follow your star. . . you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy." --Said by Miss Tick, page 39, The Wee Free Men, by Terry Pratchett.Overall, I really loved this book. It has an excellent plot, and Pratchett wrote in an engaging and funny way that still managed to get the main points across. The language and old Scottish words he used to describe the characters, speech, and landscapes were very interesting, and every character in the book was unique; even all the Wee Free Men (also called Feegles) who had the same word patterns and general appearance were easily distinguishable from each other. I absolutely recommend this book and would read it again. <br>The same word or name is used where a pronoun should replace it<a href="#fnref-1-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>
<br>it was he who did the rescuing.<a href="#fnref-2-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>
<br>There's a bit too much italicized in the essay, this is one example<a href="#fnref-3-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>
<br>This isn't quite grammatically correct, insert "that" before the lesson.<a href="#fnref-4-ff62d2a7138dbe75" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>

The adjusted term is like an infiltrator, sitting in exactly the same place as the original variable would have been, but...
It alters the value just before the rest of the expression gets a chance to work with it. The expression ends up computing all of its values as if the axis was shifted by that amount, so the resulting graph is shifted.
A similar thing happens when you multiply a coordinate variable - If for example you double the coordinate, the effect is as if the x-axis is stretched by a factor of 2, and so the graph itself is squished to half the size in the x dimension.
This is always true for any graph of any equation, as long as every instance of the variable is modified in the same way. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Equation%20of%20a%20circle:%20$(x-x_0)%5E2%20+%20(y-y_0)%5E2%20=%20r%5E2$" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Equation%20of%20a%20circle:%20$(x-x_0)%5E2%20+%20(y-y_0)%5E2%20=%20r%5E2$" target="_self">Youtube search for "Equation of a circle: <span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span>"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=In%20any%20graph,%20why%20is%20it%20that%20subtracting%20something%20from%20the%20coordinate%20variable%20($x$%20or%20$y$),%20shifts%20the%20graph%20in%20the%20*positive%20direction*%20for%20that%20coordinate?" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=In%20any%20graph,%20why%20is%20it%20that%20subtracting%20something%20from%20the%20coordinate%20variable%20($x$%20or%20$y$),%20shifts%20the%20graph%20in%20the%20*positive%20direction*%20for%20that%20coordinate?" target="_self">Youtube search for "In any graph, why is it that subtracting something from the coordinate variable (<span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span> or <span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span>), shifts the graph in the <em></em> for that coordinate?"</a>positive direction (a) Find an equation whose graph is a circle with center and radius .

This lesson is all about connecting those two worlds so that you can use them together. Everything you did in straight geometry has a counterpart in analytic geometry, and all of the proof results and theorems are still true. Analytic geometry just gives you more tools to find those crucial points, segments, areas, etc.So, as you approach these problems, it might help to think, "How would I do this with just compass and straightedge?" to get an idea of the sequence of steps you need. Then, you can think, "Now, how can I get the important points using what I know from the analytic description of the problem?"Sticking the two ways of thinking together is not easy, but it's very powerful. Another helpful thing you can do is to try to come up with all of the formulas you know that relate to the problem's different kinds of quantities (lengths, locations, areas, volumes) and then also think of the results from geometry that you know that could be related, and see how you might bounce back and forth between them to break through sticking points in the problem.

Choose one that makes your life easy! Choosing a coordinate system that makes as many things as possible equal to zero is a good place to start Once again, we're tying things we know from algebra together with things we know from geometry. One of the biggest hurdles is understanding how to connect them, and the first place we start is with the coordinate system. Coordinates act like translators, taking the lengths and angles of pure geometry into the realm of things we can use tools of algebra on. We're always working with an abstract idea of a shape, and we have different representations of that shape based on the various mathematical tools we have at hand. Later, you'll learn how to use even more representations. The important thing to realize is that the shape itself is what connects all of these representations. If something is true algebraically for a right triangle, it's true for any representation of a right triangle. Here's what you need to remember:
You can put the coordinate system's origin ANYWHERE YOU WANT, and you can orient it in ANY DIRECTION! So, pick one that makes your life as easy as possible. Just make sure the axes are perpendicular, and the divisions are all the same size. Choosing good axes makes many things into zeros, and makes other things be equal to each other
Using variables as the individual coordinates means that your representation is valid for all possible variations of that shape!
Just be careful not to assume that things line up on the coordinates a certain way because the diagram looks like it should - you have to know the properties of your shape. For example, the legs of a right triangle will always align with perpendicular axes, but that does not mean all triangles will. Make sure you're not proving something about a restricted class of shapes by accident! It's useful to put a vertex at the origin most of the time, but always think about it before you do because there might be a better place as well.
If you don't see a solution immediately, try a few different ways of locating your coordinate system. Look for: Ways to put a segment of the diagram directly on an axis
Ways to put a vertex in an easy location
Ways to use symmetry in combination with the origin to simplify the math Many people think of those tricks as cheating, because what if you can't do that some time??" None of those things is cheating, they're just the right thing to do in order to solve the problem. In other words, cheat as much as possible! If you come across a problem where you can't use these tricks, that just means it's a different kind of problem, and it's going to be a lot harder. So don't borrow trouble. <br><img alt="_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/9273fa4967e6647d23d629dfece0a1d3_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/9273fa4967e6647d23d629dfece0a1d3_md5.jpeg" target="_self"><br><img alt="_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/4797c6d806e0c9bae7c8187df6fc1d6a_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/4797c6d806e0c9bae7c8187df6fc1d6a_md5.jpeg" target="_self"><br><img alt="_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/6aef39d5ebfd9f1be2485a8af0779501_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/17-4-proofs-with-analytic-geometry/6aef39d5ebfd9f1be2485a8af0779501_md5.jpeg" target="_self">“Pasted image 20250505062455.png” could not be found.

Perpendicular things have negative, inverse slopes... And we know how to find the equation of a line from a point and slope. Given two line equations, the point where they cross is just the point where both are true, so solve them as a system of equations to get the end point
Finally, find the distance between the point and the intersection. Find the distance between the point and the graph of the line . <br><img alt="_resources/17-5-distance-between-a-point-and-line/84bf0ae5726eeca97e520bffbe53e66f_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/17-5-distance-between-a-point-and-line/84bf0ae5726eeca97e520bffbe53e66f_md5.jpeg" target="_self">

Introduction

Problem and solution discussion
Conclusion and future work Your overarching goal is clarity. Don't be long-winded, don't use thick jargon, explain things as clearly and simply as possible. Use diagrams whenever you can to help with explanations.
Consider your audience: Your audience determines what kind of information you focus on and how advanced the writing can be. Who is your audience?
Grammar is important: You know this, so just make sure you check yourself.
Accuracy and completeness: You must be careful to be accurate and specific in this report. Do NOT exaggerate or use vague language. Don't claim capabilities that aren't complete, and don't undersell things that do work.
Explaining things clearly is hard: Don't expect this to be easy! You need to find a way to communicate dense technical information to your reader in a way that helps them understand! Don't try to impress them with how tough it is to understand, try to impress them with how well you explain it! If you expect your reader to need a bottle of ibuprofen handy before they start, you're doing it wrong. Spend extra time simplifying and clarifying your explanations, but don't make them juvenile. They should be focused, directly and clearly worded, and sequenced properly to help your readers build up their understanding. <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (lang) Outline the content for your engineering report on your robot design.

If the middle sensor sees the line, go straight
If the left sensor sees the line, spin in place to the left until the middle sensor sees it
If the right sensor sees the line, spin in place to the right until the middle sensor sees it
This works, but it's very inefficient in terms of motion speed. How could we do better?
As long as one side sensor is detecting the line, we're not that far off. Maybe we can just veer to that side while still moving forward. Adjust the inside wheel speed down, or the outside wheel speed up, and continue
If we lose the line entirely, it's time to spin toward the last side that saw it. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Checking%20sensors,%20adjustability" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Checking%20sensors,%20adjustability" target="_self">Youtube search for "Checking sensors, adjustability"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Options%20for%20control" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Options%20for%20control" target="_self">Youtube search for "Options for control"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (engr) Time your bot as it goes around the track a few times and record the data. <a data-href="2025-04-22" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-04-22</a>

We're going to use it in a very basic form for a while, to keep track of your income so that we can get money into a Roth IRA.
Create a folder at the path Documents/records/finance
Create a file in that folder called 2025.journal: cd ~/Documents/records/finance; touch 2025.journal
Create a symlink to that file in your home directory, with the name .hledger.journal: cd; ln -s ~/Documents/records/finance/2025.journal .hledger.journal
Now, set up your initial accounts. Put this into your journal file:
account assets:bank:savings ; type:A,
account assets:investment:roth ; type:A,
account assets:cash ; type:A,
account equity ; type:E,
account equity:openingbalances ; type:E,
account revenues:income ; type:R,
account expenses:purchases ; type:X,
Next, we'll set up your initial balances. Look up your bank account balance, and use the following command to get it set up:hledger addhledger add will open up an interactive prompt that will ask you a few questions and then generate the entries you describe. The first transaction we're going to enter is going to hold our opening balances, which just means we're saying "here's how much money we're starting with." When hledger asks for the first account, use assets:bank:savings. The amount should be whatever you have in the account right now.The next account can be your cash if you have any. Use assets:cash, and enter the amount of money you have floating around. If you don't have any, skip this part.After you have all of your assets recorded, the last account is going to be equity:openingbalances. This is a placeholder to let you know that all of this money came from somewhere, but you didn't track it. Just accept the default for the amount (it will automatically be the negative of whatever you entered up to now), and tell it to save the transaction. You can press ctrl-d to exit the prompt when you're done adding transactions.When you make some money, record it in hledger using the hledger add command. In this case, the positive money amount will go to wherever you put the money after you got it (either assets:cash or assets:bank:savings usually). The balancing (negative) amount is recorded under revenues:income. You can think of income as being the account for the rest of the world - after you get some income, the rest of the world has that much less and you have that much more. This way it all balances out, and money isn't created from nothing.When you buy something, record it using hledger add by adding an amount to expenses. That means that the positive amount will go under expenses:spending, and the negative amount will be on whatever acount you spent money from (either assets:cash or assets:bank:savings for now).Investing in stocks or other things that aren't money is a bit more complicated. Here, you need to tell hledger that the thing you're getting is its own store of value, called a commodity. To declare a commodity, you can give it a pattern to look for:commodity $1,000.00
commodity VTI
The first one says to format dollar amounts with two decimal places and commas. The second one says that there's something called "VTI" that you might own (that's the stock ticker for the Vanguard Total Market Index, by the way).Now you can record buying your commodities with hledger add. The positive account will be assets:investments:roth, and the negative will be assets:bank:savings (or cash, if you can buy with cash somehow). To record that you bought 3 shares of VTI for $249.99 each, you'd enter the amount for the assets:investments:roth account like this:3 VTI @ $244.99When the other account value is asked, you can't let it be empty so you have to accept the commodity line. You'll have to go into the journal file and delete the balancing amount so that it infers the cost for you, otherwise you get weird issues with stock shares coming directly from your bank account.When it's done, the stock buy transation should look like this:2025-02-05 buy 3 VTI assets:investments:roth 3 VTI @ $244.88 assets:bank:savings
You have somebody doing work for you, and you want to keep track of how much they should be paid at the next pay period. Their work creates a debt that you owe, which you periodically pay off from an asset account.P mow_field $50 2025-04-11 gr10 mowed west field expenses:labor:gr10 1 mow_field liabilities:owed:gr10 2025-04-11 Paid gr10 liabilities:owed:gr10 $50 assets:cash
Scenario:
gr10 mows the pasture, earning $50.00, which goes in as a liability that I owe to her
She asks me to buy a month of crunchyroll for her for $8.00, by canceling some of her owed wages
Mental model:
She works to mow the grass, and I owe her $50.00. I am buying crunchyroll with my own credit card for $8.00. She offers to pay me back, which means she incurs a debt to me that balances the crunchyroll expense. I then forgive her debt by having her forgive my debt.P mowing $50 2025-04-11 gr10 mowed west field expenses:labor:gr10 1 mowing liabilities:owed:gr10 2025-04-11 buy crunchyroll month for gr10 expenses:fun $8.00 liabilities:amazonchase 2025-04-11 gr10 reimburses by owing me assets:debts:gr10 $8.00 expenses:fun 2025-04-11 I credit gr10's debt by canceling some of my debt to her assets:debts:gr10 -$8.00 liabilities:owed:gr10
The net result of all of that would be equivalent to me just using my credit card to pay part of her wages, which would look like this:2025-04-11 I pay for crunchyroll for gr10 liabilities:amazonchase -$8.00 liabilities:owed:gr10 $8.00
By adding a positive value to the liabilties:owed:gr10 account, I'm reducing the amount I owe to her.]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/personal-finance/lessons/hledger-intro.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/personal-finance/lessons/hledger-intro.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[experiment-center-of-mass]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Sometimes that's not really practical (most of the time, really). In those cases, we'll need to count up parts of the problem separately and then add up the total afterwards.Whenever you come across a counting problem that has choices that end up with different values, just use your knowledge to count those cases individually and then add the results. The figure to the right represents a road map between 4 villages, labeled , , and . The arcs indicate paths between the various villages.

Probability doesn't tell us exactly what will happen! It tells us how likely different things are to happen if we try something over and over. If you think of the different possibilities as buckets, and the trials as "throwing a grain of sand into one of the buckets," then probability tells us approximately how much each bucket will weigh after we do millions of trials. It doesn't tell us the exact number of sand grains, but it does give a very good estimate of the overall situation at the end.
First off, we have to make a new term: discrete event. A discrete event is something that's countable with whole-numbers, like "how many times a die rolls 3." There are other things that really don't make sense to count that way, like "how much water is in the container?" We're going to be working with discrete things for now.Computing probabilities for discrete events generally comes down to a short process that looks like this:
Figure out how to count the number of possible ways something could turn out
Figure out how to count the number of ways where it turns out being what we're wanting
Divide the second by the first.
The counting is the hard part!
The faces of a fair 6-sided die are numbered 1-6. (“Fair” means that each side is equally likely to be rolled.) What is the probability that when the die is rolled, a 2 is facing up?
What is the probability that when a fair 6-sided die is rolled, an odd number faces up? What is the greatest possible probability for any event? What is the least possible probability for any event? A standard deck of cards has 52 cards divided into 4 suits, each of which has 13 cards. Two of the suits ( and , called “hearts” and “diamonds”) are red, and the other two ( and , called “spades” and “clubs”) are black. The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called “shuffling”). What is the probability that the top two cards are both red (this is tricky!)? Suppose we have 2 fair 6-sided dice numbered from dice-blue-1 to dice-blue-6. If we roll them both, then what is the probability that the two numbers shown sum to 7? <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (math) (gr7) 14.5 Probability (p. 536) <a data-href="2025-05-02" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-05-02</a> ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/lessons/14-5-probability.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/lessons/14-5-probability.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[15-1-looking-for-patterns]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Sometimes there just aren't that many possible answers. That's another time when writing them down and filtering them out is fast and convenient.
When you're going to make a list, try to start with the most restrictive property because it will give you the smallest set of things at the beginning.
Remember: Getting the correct answer is the goal here, not proving you can do hard work. If you have a clever way to get it done, just use it (as long as it's actually you doing the work, not just looking up the answer or asking AI...).
Elizabeth spent exactly for some -cent stamps and some -cent stamps. How many -cent stamps did she buy? Find a two-digit positive integer with all these properties: the tens digit is larger than the ones digit (units digit),
the difference between the digits is greater than 3,
the sum of the digits is greater than 10, and the integer is a multiple of 12. A partition of a positive integer is a way of writing as the sum of positive integers in which the order of the numbers in the sum doesn’t matter. For example, the partitions of 3 are 3, , and . We consider and to be the same, so there are 3 partitions of 3.

Proportional navigation: Try to control steering to make the line-of-sight angle constant, so you're on an "intercept triangle"
Here's the main idea in a nutshell: You want your tank to be on one side of a triangle, and the enemy tank to be on another side. Since triangles come to points, that guarantees you'll intercept them if you can keep going long enough.You know if you're on a triangle by watching the angle between the direction you're heading and the target. If the angle isn't changing, you're on an intercept triangle. If the angle is changing, then you should steer in the direction of the change.The proportional part is a tuning parameter you can use to decide how much you turn when the angle is changing - bigger numbers mean sharper turns.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUUsDDE1sI" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUUsDDE1sI" target="_self">Shot leading without trigonometry</a><br>

We're going to work on a tank-battle game, where two players each get a small army of autonomous tanks, and they battle each other in an arena to see which one has better tactics.We're going to use <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://brm.io/matter-js/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://brm.io/matter-js/" target="_self">matter.js</a> physics library to start with

The ultimate end-state game will be a real-time 4X strategy in which your autonomous tank army tries to assert control over a large territory by forcing enemies out of it. The larger the territory, the more stuff you get in order to keep expanding and defending your borders.The programmable tanks are the base mechanic. Each player gets to have a code base that controls the tanks, and a library of sensors and effectors to interact with the world. The tech tree will have improvements in all aspects, achievable by dominating a large enough territory to dedicate the required resources to research for the required amount of time.<br>Tanks are controlled by scripts written in typescript that are loaded as a Function (for now). A better alternative is in the SES hardened javascript package (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/master/packages/ses/docs/guide.md" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/master/packages/ses/docs/guide.md" target="_self">here's a link to the documentation, such as it is</a>). The tank update script is given two data structures - one that represents the control signals (including the currently-set signals from the last run), and one that has sensor data. The tank's code does its work, then returns an updated control structure.The controls are simple:
Left-side track speed
Right-side track speed
Gun turn deg per sec
radar turn deg per sec
Tanks in the future will have many more modules that can be earned through powerups and tech tree advancements. Each of those will have some combination of extra controls and sensors that the code can access. They'll all be accessible by name, which ultimately will be something the user can define.
Goal: Get one tank to draw itself on the screen
Goal: Get the tank to move around under control of the code
Goal: Basic graphics that don't look terrible
Goal: Deterministic replay Need to make a fixed time step
Need to control the random number generator Goal: Modular controls and sensors There is a Control and a Sensor base class
They each have direct access to the physics of the game world and the tank's body
Each sensor is updated just before the code runs for that iteration
Each control is updated just after the code runs for that iteration
Instances of these are responsible for building and parsing the controls and sensors portions of the update messages <br>The current best-looking option for running untrusted code is to use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://hardenedjs.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://hardenedjs.org" target="_self">hardened JS</a>. It looks like you can make a thing called a Compartment that gives you a functional JS environment that can do all of the normal things, but can't do anything to the outside world that you don't explicitly grant it permission to do.<br>So, if I want to use the import eval method described <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://2ality.com/2019/10/eval-via-import.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://2ality.com/2019/10/eval-via-import.html" target="_self">here</a>, I think all I have to do is create a container and harden it, then use that to do the eval.
Importing the ses module creates the function lockdown. Calling lockdown mutates the global environment and adds the Compartment constructor.
In order to use this, I need to make sure all of my scripts are loaded, then call lockdown() somewhere. After that call is made, there will be a Compartment constructor available.Somehow, this works with the LSP in nvim, but I have no idea how.
For some reason, I can't use import("some data url") from within any typescript file, or any file that was bundled by esbuild. I have to put the function outside of all of that and attach it to the global window object
I can't even call the function without jumping through hoops, referencing it by window['load_script'] rather than just using its name.
Need to resolve this somehow... but it's currently working for non-hardened scripting. <br>use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.typescriptlang.org/dev/sandbox/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/dev/sandbox/" target="_self">typescript sandbox</a> to give a decent code editor to work with.
Connect the code edits to the tank's running code. Goal: multiple tanks driving on the screen at the same time
Goal: Collisions work with physical simulation of effects Goal: The turret has a graphical representation that can point in the right direction
Requirement: The turret is a child of the tank, so it inherits the tank's rotation Tanks can fire bullets with varying levels of power Tank radar can detect the presence of walls, bullets, and other tanks, and it reports position and velocity for all hits. The tanks have an energy reserve that they use for boosting to temporarily higher speeds
Tanks can be damaged by bullets and by collisions Collisions do less damage when the front of the tank is what gets hit (so ramming can work). Define a scoring system for games that end in a timeout instead of decisive victory. Ideas (maybe, one point each?): Most damage dealt
Most durability left
Most damage per shot
Fewest collisions with terrain
Fastest first kill Create an overlay to show tank health, current stats, time left, and any debug output
Allow the user to select a tank for focus to see debug messages
Allow a rewind? Roll back time for debugging purposes. The simulation should be deterministic, so this should be possible.

It's an incredibly versatile thing, and it's also not as easy as you'd think to get it done quickly. We're going to learn the simplest sorting algorithm I know today, and talk about how slow it is. It's called Bubble Sort.It gets its name from the way the elements move through the list while you're sorting it (the biggest elements tend to bubble to the end of the list).All sorting algorithms have a few things in common:
They always sort things by comparing two at a time
They always impose a new order on the results without changing the size of the lists
Here's the basic idea:
Start at the first element of the list, and look at the ordering of it and the next one.
If they're in the right order, move on to the next element.
If they're in the wrong order, swap them!
Now move to the next element of the list (don't skip any, even if it's the one you just swapped!)
Go to step 2 and repeat until you reach the end of the list
Go to step 1 and repeat, but stop one element farther from the end for each iteration until there are only two unsorted elements left, then sort them!
The algorithm will pick up the biggest element it has seen up until each point and carry it along until it either reaches the end of the unsorted items, or it reaches the end of the list. In either case, it drops the biggest item and starts over.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BubbleSortNew.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BubbleSortNew.html" target="_self">Bubble Sort animation</a>

We had two stages of work there though - first, you wrote code that wrangled low-level bits of the Arduino library to just make it work. Then, we switched to using our IRSensor classes. The IRSensor class is designed to encapsulate the complexity of the IR obstacle sensors we're using, turning their avoidance behavior into a detection behavior by inverting the sense of the output. By default, the sensors output LOW when nothing is detected, and HIGH when an obstacle is found. This makes sense if you're using them to avoid running into stuff. However, we're using them to see whether we're on a black line or not, and the sensor reports LOW when it's on the line and HIGH when it's off. That is very confusing when you're working on code that depends on it, and it leads to lots of errors. Our class encapsulates the sensor and provides a different interface that makes sense for line-following. It keeps track of the last sensor reading, and it maps the HIGH or LOW into two different functions: obstacle_detected and on_line. Now, we can use the sensor for both purposes, and we have functions that will just tell us what we want to know. They hide the complexity of working with the sensor behind a very simple, very small API.This is both the principle of least privilege and the separation of concerns at work. The principle of least privilege requires that you give users of your code as little power as possible to mess things up. In security, that means you limit their access to files, services, and other stuff to just the bare essentials that are absolutely required for the work being done. In this case, we're hiding the pin assignments, digitalWrite and digitalRead call structure, and the state of the sensor behind a bare essential interface that protects the rest of our code from user mistakes.
Separation of concerns means that you divide your code into pieces that each focus as fully as possible on one limited concern. The concern in this case is determining whether we're on a line or not, and the IRSensor class handles that and nothing else. Anything that wants to know the state of "on-line-ness" has to ask the sensor, and the sensor doesn't do any extra stuff like making sandwiches or browsing funny cat videos.
This is all done for one main reason: maintainability of code. Your brain works by keeping a few things at a time (usually 4-6) in working memory, and using its knowledge of relationships to figure things out about how those things work together. Becoming an expert in something doesn't mean that you can hold more in working memory, it means that the 4-6 things in your working memory have a lot more information attached. In other words, you have a mental data structure that holds a lot more stuff in just the right place so that you can actually think about it effectively because it's not taking up a whole memory slot.Separation of concerns is basically a direct mapping of working memory limitations onto code. By wrapping up the IRSensor complexity into a class, we now can just think "what should my sensor do here" instead of "what should I write to pin 13, then how long do I need to delay to make sure it's enabled before I read from pin 12 and invert the bit because I'm looking for a line instead of an obstacle reflection...". The concept we get to work with matches the function it's meant to perform, and once that code is correct we probably won't ever have to dig into it again! It's just a simple concept now: Ask the sensor if we're on the line, and it will tell us yes or no.So how does that help code maintenance? At this point, functions that use the sensor can put the entire sensor into a single working memory spot in your brain, and you can reason about the function overall without cluttering up your mind with pin assignments and stuff. So, if a bug is found, you're able to actually think about the function and fix it, rather than single-stepping through the byzantine labyrinth of low-level bit wrangling code.How to principle of least privilege relate to this? We know that nothing else in our code is allowed to mess with sensor stuff! So if there's a problem with the sensor, it should be in that particular piece of code, not in some unrelated file somewhere else. We also know that the sensor should not effect anything outside of its domain, so we can rule it out for causing other problems. The reality is less strong than that, because we don't actually have a way to prevent other code from wrangling the pins and bits directly. However, if we are strict with ourselves and require all of our code to obey these principles, we defend ourselves from a lot of very difficult bugs.The more you can apply these ideas to your code, the more complexity you'll be able to manage, and the less time you'll spend fixing extremely confusing problems. Spend extra time thinking about how you can write code that is strict about separation of concerns and principle of least privilege. It will pay off!Some changes:
The code module you are making is now expected to have one function named setup that gets exported.
The setup function is supposed to return an object that has an update method, which takes the TankAPI parameter (this is exactly like the loop function from before).
The object should fully encapsulate all of the stuff it needs to work, because we'll be making multiple copies and they all need to play nicely. No global variables please
Javascript and typescript have a litle bit of weirdness about the this object (big surprise, right?). this doesn't necessarily always refer to the class instance, it can also refer to the function object itself. So, when you create a closure inside a member method, your this pointer might change in mysterious ways, and everything will explode into flaming wreckage for no apparent reason. Here's how you can work around it: use the bind method, and make an alias for this that isn't a keyword.You can tell a function what to use for the this pointer by binding it (this is javascript code, not typescript:function foo(n) { this.n = n;
} let yada = { n:0 };
let foothis = foo.bind(yada);
foothis(100); // call the version with this bound to yada
console.log("yada.n = ", yada.n); // prints out yada.n = 100
If you want to be able to pass a member method from your class around as a function that other code can call, just bind it:class Bar { donk(n:number) { this.n = n; } n:number
}
let b = new Bar();
callThisFunctionLater(Bar.donk.bind(b));
If you're in a member method and you want to return a closure that will need to have a way to talk back to your class, you should make an alias of this and use it in the closure. Otherwise, the closure will likely have its own this pointer and your code will not work!class Gar { some_member_method():()=&gt;void { let self = this; // keep a copy of the 'this' pointer that I actually want return () =&gt; { self.do_a_method(); } }

However, there's a problem: It's hard to compare one histogram to another! Our corpus of text that we use for a model probably has thousands of characters in it, while the cryptogram probably only has dozens. That means the actual numbers in the two things are going to be nothing alike! One is going to be orders of magnitude larger than the other, and that makes it hard to line things up.In order to make our lives easier, we're going to convert the histogram into a probability distribution. A probability distribution is just a collection of all possibilities, each of which has a certain chance of happening. Notice that I said all possibilities and chance of happening. That means that every number in a probability distribution is less than or equal to 1, and they all add up to 1.Turning a histogram into a PDF (probability distribution function) is easy - just add up all of the terms in the histogram, then divide each one by the total. If you do that, you'll have a whole collection of fractions with a common denominator, all of which add up to exactly one!This process is called normalizing the data - we scale it up or down so that we can make better comparisons. Now, instead of just aligning our character arrays by frequency, we're going to try to find the best match for each character mapping. We'll still want to start with sorted arrays, but instead of just picking the next element from the corpus each time, we'll keep our current ciphertext letter active until we find the corpus letter with the closest probability, and use that one as our substitution.This is still not going to solve the cryptogram! However, it will get us a lot closer.

Sometimes there are some hints of words in there, but mostly it's just gibberish. Today we're going to use the digrams to try to improve this situation.The nice thing about digrams is that there are WAY MORE of them! That means that the number of valid pairs is kind of small compared to the number of all possible pairs, and that lets us do a couple of nice tricks:
First, we can preload our crypto key map with the most likely letters according to the digrams. That means things like th, he, it, is, ss, ll, tt that show up all over the place will fill in several of our letters with really good possibilities.
Second, there are a lot of pairings that just don't ever happen - stuff like xq and wv. It turns out that the digram frequencies give us a lot more usable info than the single letter frequencies, but they don't generally cover all of the cases.
So, our end-game cracking tool is going to work on this problem a letter at a time. First, we use digrams to pick out pairs of letters that are very likely to be correct. Then, we start trying out single-letters to fill in the gaps, using a few tests for each letter to make sure it fits with the map we have so far.Ultimately we're going to be making something that performs a search through the possible crypto keys, trying to find the one that makes output that looks like english text. Each step along the way, we'll have a key that represents our best guess so far, and we'll have a score for each key that's based on how good we think it is so far. We'll always work on the key that has the best score, and by doing that we can avoid even checking almost all of the keys. That's a good thing, because there are possibilities! Our program would never finish if we had to look at each one...This kind of algorithm is called heuristic search. A "heuristic" is kind of a quick way to gauge the quality of something, and a search just means we're looking through a lot of stuff to find what we want. The heuristic here is our answer to the question, "How likely is it that these substitutions could output real english?" We'll make a function that answers that question with a number, and we'll use that number to decide which key we should try next.Every step of the way, we have a lot of choices for how we could assign a letter substitution. Our job will be to pick the ones that are likely to be the best and pursue them, but we don't want to forget our other options in case our guess wasn't very good. That's where the "search" part comes in. We're going to make all of our possible key maps "get in line," and then we'll take one off the front of the line, update it, and put it back in line, over and over again, until we have a good key. If we keep the line sorted by score, then we should be able to find a good key!To get started on this, we're just going to make a key builder that has two stages. First, use your digram_frequencies function to pick the top two digrams from both the corpus and the cryptogram. We're working with short text here, so the hope is that at least these ones will be pretty good.Use those two digrams to insert the first three or four mappings (there may be duplicate letters!) into the key, assuming that they correspond to each other. Later, we'll add some searching to this process, but for now we're just going to assume the first guess is right (how's that for confidence?).After you have those inserted, use the letter_frequencies to fill in the rest of the mappings. Remember that you can't have two things that map to the same result, and you can't have one letter that maps to two different results! You'll need to keep track of which mappings already exist and filter them out of the running while you choose what to use next.let key = new Map();
let cipher_digram_freq = digram_frequencies(ciphertext);
let corpus_digram_freq = digram_frequencies(corpus);
// pick the biggest two from each
let cipher_mondo_digrams = map2hist(cipher_digram_freq) // this makes our sorted array .slice(0,2); // and this takes the first two elements out of it
let corpus_mondo_digrams = map2hist(corpus_digram_freq) // make the sorted array .slice(0,2); // get the first two elements
// We have the top two digrams from the ciphertext and the corpus now. They'll look something like
// [["th",17],["es",15]] for the corpus, and [["xp", 5], ["qw", 3]] for the ciphertext.
// Now you need to make a map that has entries like this in it: {'x'=&gt;'t','p'=&gt;'h','q'=&gt;'e', 'w'=&gt;'s'}.
// We took each letter from the top digrams in the cryptogram and mapped it to the corresponding letter // from the corpus. Here's one of them for example:
key.set(cipher_mondo_digrams[0][0], corpus_mondo_digrams[0][0]);
// Watch out! English has lots of double-letter digrams in it (like 'tt', 'ee', 'll'). For now, try // to avoid using those in this part. They will be very handy later on though!
// Now, get the single letter frequencies (your job)
// Filter out the ones that are already defined
// Insert the rest of the single letter frequencies in order of best frequency match. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=digram%20matching%20for%20the%20most%20common%20letter%20pairs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=digram%20matching%20for%20the%20most%20common%20letter%20pairs" target="_self">Youtube search for "digram matching for the most common letter pairs"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=picking%20out%20word%20fragments" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=picking%20out%20word%20fragments" target="_self">Youtube search for "picking out word fragments"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (programming) Write a function that uses digram frequency to find the most common letter pairs (maybe the top 5 sets) and assign those to their places, then use single letter frequencies to fill in the rest. <a data-href="2025-02-17" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-17</a>

<br>Last time, we counted letters in a piece of text. That by itself is a pretty useful tool for breaking classical crypto, but we can do even better. It turns out that English has a much stronger pattern to it when you look at pairs of letters rather than single letters. If you look at this link: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/digraphs.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/digraphs.html" target="_self">digraph frequencies in English text</a>, you'll see an interesting thing: they only gave frequencies for the 22 most common digrams, even though there are possible pairs. That's because they are very unevenly distributed!That's good news for us as codebreakers, because it lets us rule out a lot of potential solutions based on how unlikely the digrams are. Say you've found 10 possible single-letter simple substitution cipher keys that give believable letter frequencies. That means that you can use any of them to "decipher" the message, but only one of them will actually be correct. You could then take a look at what the digram frequencies of each would give you, and you'll probably be able to rule out almost all of the bad ones immediately! That's because digrams are a lot more sparse than single letters, and the weird ones are often actually impossible to find in correct english text.

In this case, we have the Radar, which can tell us the direction and distance to a target (so far, the only target is the wall). This assignment is about using that sensor data to drive toward the first spot on the wall that your radar detects. There are a few parts to this:
Keeping track of which direction you need to be moving - you should be moving toward the actual spot on the wall that your radar detected, not just anywhere on the wall
Keeping track of how far you need to go. The idea is to stop before you hit the wall, so that your distance is as close as possible to 30 (again, in the direction the radar specified).
You can either just take note of the direction and distance and move directly there, or you can keep the radar aimed at its spot and just drive until you're the right distance away. You can decide which way to do it, or you could try both.

When we're done, we should be able to use cipher_key_map.get(ciphertext_letter) and it should return to us a likely plaintext letter. It won't be exactly right! This is a messy science, and we're going to add more features to our tools as we proceed with this big project, so when you get garbled text out of it, that's okay!We're going to get the letter frequencies of regular English text (called the model here), and of our encrypted text (called the ciphertext here). Then we're going to sort them, so that the most frequently-used letters in each piece of text come first. Finally, we're going to pair them up, so that we have a Map with the keys being letters from our encrypted message, and the values being the most likely letter they should be transformed into.Later, we'll make this interactive so that you can use it to figure out the right key string, but for now it's just going to give us its best first guess.Here's how it needs to work:
It should be a function that takes two strings as arguments. The first string is a model of text that should be similar to the decrypted version of our message
The second string is the encrypted text, or ciphertext Compute the letter_frequencies for each string and keep the results handy
Turn each map into an array of letters, sorted by their frequency in the map
Make a new map by running down the lengths of those two arrays and making the ciphertext array the key, and the plaintext array the value.
Return the new Map.
Javascript array sorting is notorious for being janky. In order to make sure we're getting the result we want, we need to make a special helper function that will convert our Map into an Array of [string,number] pairs. Then, we'll sort the array with a comparison function that only looks at the numbers.First, get the pairs out of the map like this:let letter_freq_pairs = Array.from(mymap.entries())
<br>Next, we have to sort them. To do that, we can use the Array.sort method (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" target="_self">Array.sort documentation</a>):Array.from(letter_freq_pairs) .sort((a,b)=&gt;b[1]-a[1])
We pass the sort function our own special function to do the comparison our way (instead of turning them into strings and comparing the numbers as if they were words...). sort expects to give you two arguments (a and b), and it wants you to return:
0 if they are equal if a should come before b if a should come after b
By subtracting with b-a, we're getting the list sorted from greatest to least. Also, notice that we're only comparing the count part of the key/value pair we got from the map! That means we're sorting the pairs, but we're only looking at the frequency to make our ordering.It turns out that combining two arrays into an array of pairs (or something else similar) is a pretty common thing to want to do. We have a special name for a function that does that: zip. Take a look at this code and see if you can figure out how it works:function zip(a:number[], b:number[]):number[][] { return a.map((key,index) =&gt; [key, b[index]])
}
How could you use this function in our code project for today?We got a list of pairs, but that's not really what we wanted. It would be nice if we could get a Map...Here's another function you might find useful, try to figure out what it does:

<br><a data-href="differential-steering-bot" href="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/engineering-projects/differential-steering-bot.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">differential-steering-bot</a> Class hierarchies typescript vs c++ Headers and declarations vs implementations The c++ preprocessor Incremental updates Today we're going to pair-program our way through a couple of simple state machine implementations, one in typescript and one in c++. We'll see how the two are similar and how they are different, and we'll talk about some tradeoffs for implementing state machines. There are two main approaches to making a state machine, and they each have strengths and weaknesses: The giant switch statement
The class hierarchy
The most straightforward way to make a state machine is to just have a simple switch statement that does something specific for each different state:switch(state) {
case STATE_1: do_state1_stuff(); break;
case STATE_2: do_state2_stuff(); break;
//...
default: do_default_stuff(); break;
}
This approach has some nice features! Don't discount it because it's so simple. Here's what it's good for:
Getting a working state machine done quickly. These are very quick to write, and they're easy to debug becasue everything is in the same place.
Implementing a small state machine in the most readable way. When your state machine doesn't have dozens or hundreds of states, this is a good option. It's small, it's very fast (running and easy to write), and it's pretty simple to maintain.
No overhead - Using classes and virtual functions makes your code just a tiny bit slower because of something called dynamic dispatch. The switch statement avoids that. This is generally not an important reason to do this, because you probably have other things in the code that cause thousands of times more slowdown than this! This approach is weak when:
There are more than a handful of states to juggle
You have to do things on entry and on leaving of each state. In this approach, you have to make extra states representing the enter and leave for each of the other states Example: for a Drive state, you'd need to add EnterDrive and LeaveDrive as separate states with their own transitions. The states themselves have different data attached to them. You have to store all of that stuff somewhere, and it ends up being in a giant structure usually
In this version of the state machine, we make classes for:
The state machine itself
The state base class, which describes the interface that every state has to have
Each of the individual states.
The state machine keeps track of the currently-active state, and it has the list of possible states that could be active. The active state is always an instance of the State base class, and it always has functions that you can call to enter, update, and leave. The state machine also has a way to let the active state tell it to switch to a different state. This might be a return value from the update function, or it might be a message sent, or the state machine can just pass a reference to itself into the state's update function so the state can tell it when something has to happen. The third option is the most frequently used, but it has some problems with strict languages like rust.<br>There is an example of a c++ state machine in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="line-following" data-href="line-following" href="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/line-following.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Line Following</a> lesson.The class hierarchy approach is good for more complex state machines, where having all of the state code in a single file is just not practical. In this case, splitting it up into state classes makes the code a lot easier to understand, and it gives you some extra powers:
enter and leave are easy to implement. In the switch version, you have to make separate states for the enter and leave phases of each state that requires them.
When you're comfortable with the class hierarchy version of this, it's probably best to just default to that one. Most of the time, the number of states in your state machine will be way larger than you expected at the start! <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Class%20hierarchies" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Class%20hierarchies" target="_self">Youtube search for "Class hierarchies"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=typescript%20vs%20c++" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=typescript%20vs%20c++" target="_self">Youtube search for "typescript vs c++"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Headers%20and%20declarations%20vs%20implementations" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Headers%20and%20declarations%20vs%20implementations" target="_self">Youtube search for "Headers and declarations vs implementations"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The%20c++%20preprocessor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The%20c++%20preprocessor" target="_self">Youtube search for "The c++ preprocessor"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Incremental%20updates" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Incremental%20updates" target="_self">Youtube search for "Incremental updates"</a> ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/implenting-state-machines.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/implenting-state-machines.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[introducing-tank-battle]]></title><description><![CDATA[ <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_self">Typescript Language Home</a> <br>

By itself, this is very bland looking. We'll talk about CSS soon, but CSS is the language we use to add some style to the document below.The important things to see here:
Tags come in pairs, and each one is enclosed in angle brackets (like the tag div, which looks like this: &lt;div&gt;)
Closing tags have a slash (/ ) before the name: &lt;/div&gt; closes the &lt;div&gt; tag from before
Tags can have attributes inside that give you extra information about how to work with the content. This example uses the id tag, which gives a unique identifier to the tag, and the class tag, which is used mostly by the CSS styling system.
The content for a tag generally goes between the opening and closing parts of the tag. Tags can be nested in each other. We'll use this for creating page layouts, text with formatted parts, and other stuff. &lt;div id="container"&gt; &lt;div class="column"&gt; &lt;div id="game"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="output"&gt;some test output&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="column"&gt; &lt;div class="flex1"&gt; &lt;div id="loader"&gt;loading...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="monaco-editor-embed" style="height: 800px;" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="row"&gt; &lt;button id="shipcodebutton"&gt;ship it!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id="checkcodebutton"&gt;check it&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id="reformatcodebutton"&gt;reformat&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id="downloadbutton"&gt;download&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
Javascript is the language of web development that makes things dynamic. HTML and CSS are sufficient to make nice looking documents and even add a few effects and animations, but to get real dynamic content, you'll have to reach for javascript. Sadly, javascript development is fraught with strange choices and an extremely bloated and redundant ecosystem of tools that's very, very hard for a beginner to navigate. However, it's what we have and you can do really cool stuff with it despite the flaws.We're going to be writing our code in typescript, which is a subset of javascript that has strong types. It was created in an effort to make javascript less prone to errors and subtle bugs that are hard to find, and it is a huge improvement. It still suffers from the ecosystem problems, but in general I find the typescript development process to be a lot less painful.<br>Here's some from the same page (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/aethertap/tank-battle/blob/main/editor.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/aethertap/tank-battle/blob/main/editor.html" target="_self">editor.html</a>) in our <a data-href="tank-battle-game" href="projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/tank-battle-game.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">tank-battle-game</a> function script_loader(code) { let self=this; console.log(`script_loader: code = ${code}`); let uri = `data:text/javascript;base64,${btoa(code)}`; return import(uri) .then(scr=&gt;{ console.log("Imported script"); return scr.default; }); }
<br>This is the code that we're currently using to make the stuff you type into the editor into something your tank can actually run. NOTE: The way we're doing this right now is VERY UNSAFE and should not be used an a public app that has any kind of user data. That's because the code you enter this way has full access to the browser, so if I wrote bad code and saved it to my tank, then another user logs in and my tank's code runs against theirs, then my code could access things from their browser and do nefarious stuff.

An anonymous function is a piece of code that you can call like a function, but that doesn't have a name. We also call them "arrow functions" in typescript. They're very handy when used along with the map, reduce, and filter functions, because you can just give a quick result right in the function arguments. They are created like this:(name_of_an_arg, another_arg, some_arg_name) =&gt; do_somethign_with_the_args(name_of_an_arg, some_arg_name, another_arg)
The important parts are: A set of parentheses with argument names inside, just like a regular function declaration
An "arrow": =&gt;
An expression that generates a return value, OR a code block inside curly braces. if you use the curly braces, you have to use the return keyword or it doesn't give you a return value!
Without the curly braces, it treats the expression's result as the return value automatically (nice!) Dataview (inline field '&gt;'): Error: -- PARSING FAILED -------------------------------------------------- &gt; 1 | &gt; | ^ Expected one of the following: '(', 'null', boolean, date, duration, file link, list ('[1, 2, 3]'), negated field, number, object ('{ a: 1, b: 2 }'), string, variable
What does map do? It lets you make a new array by calling a function on every element of another array:[1,2,3].map((x) =&gt; x*2) gives [2,4,6] back! Pretty handy!You can define a function to use it like this:let evensUpTo = (n)=&gt;iota(n/2).map((x)=&gt;x*2))
let oddsUpTo = (n)=&gt;iota(n/2).map((x)=&gt;x*2+1))Reduce lets you gobble up all of the values in an array. You make a function that takes two values and returns the combination, then give reduce a starting value, and it will call your function on the current result and the next new item from the array until it runs out of stuff. You can use it to do things like add up all the numbers in an array:let add=(a,b)=&gt;a+b
[1,2,3].reduce(add, 0) would call your function like this: add(add(add(0,1),2),3), which would give 6 as the result.Filter lets you decide who lives and dies, in an array. You make a function that returns true or false, and filter calls it on every element in the array. The return value is a new array that only has elements that passed the test (your function returned true):[1,2,3,4,5,6].filter(is_even) gives [2,4,6] if is_even can check whether a number is even...

The first step in that process is to analyze the text to see how often each letter shows up (this is called the frequency of the letter). The easiest way to do that is to run through the string and increment an appropriate counter each time a letter is seen.Our first crack at it might be to make a separate variable for every letter:function letter_frequency(text:string) { let a_freq = 0; let b_freq = 0; //... for the remaining letters... for(let character of string) { if(character === 'a') { a_freq += 1; } else if (character === 'b') { b_freq += 1; } // ... 24 more if cases else { console.log(`Skipping letter ${character}`); } }
}
That would work! But, how do we actually use its output? It can't return 26 things... maybe we put them in an array? But then which letter should go in which slot? I guess we could put them in the slot corresponding to their place in the alphabet:function letter_frequency(text:string):number[] { let a_freq = 0; let b_freq = 0; //... for the remaining letters... for(let character of string) { if(character === 'a') { a_freq += 1; } else if (character === 'b') { b_freq += 1; } // ... 24 more if cases else { console.log(`Skipping letter ${character}`); } } return [a_freq,b_freq,c_freq,/*... 23 more ... */];
}
Okay, we did it! That function would work. But... it's very gross. We have the set of things we can see hard-coded into the source, which means that anything that isn't part of the 26 letters of English alphabet just gets dropped. It's also only checking for lowercase letters, and if we want to change our minds later to allow things like numbers and spaces, we'll have to change not only the letter_frequency function, but also everything that uses it AND we need to decide exactly how to lay out the array we're returning so that all of our code knows what each slot represents. It would be so much better if we could just include that information as part of the return value.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_self">Typescript/javascript Map type documentation</a><br>The <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/" target="_self">Typescript Playground</a> is very handy for experimenting with this stuff quickly. Give it a shot!It turns out, there is a data structure that's tailor-made for this job: the map (or hashtable, hashmap, object,... it has many names). This is a thing that keeps track of pairs of things: a name (called the key), and an associated value. You make a map (or object in typescript parlance) using new Map.Maps let you add keys and values for anything you like, so this is an ideal way to organize our program:function letter_frequency(text:string):Map&lt;string,number&gt; { let frequencies = new Map(); for(let character of string) { // HA! this part is your homework... // look at the documentation for Map that I linked up there ^^^ // you'll have to use the has, get, and set methods to work with the Map } return frequencies;
}
The body of the function is left as an exercise for the reader.... BUT it's really easy!One of the things you'll run into with this is that you have to filter out a lot of stuff you don't care about (things like punctuation, spaces, capitalized variants of letters, etc.). There are some nice shortcuts you can use with the map and filter functions that are part of the Array type.Since we're working with strings, you'll have to use the split function to turn the string into an array of characters, like this: let my_array = my_string.split('');. If you want to put it back into a string, you can call join on the result: let clean_string = my_array.join('');.Once you do that, you can do cool stuff:/// convert the string to all lowercase letters, and get rid of anything that isn't /// actually a letter (spaces, punctuation, numbers...)
function cleanup_string(text:string) : string { let my_array = text.split(''); let cleaned_up = my_array.map((c)=&gt;c.toLowerCase()).filter((c)=&gt;c.match(/[a-z]/)); return cleaned_up.join('');

Polling means that you ask the same question over and over again, and react when it changes. Polling is simple and straightforward and usually good enough in a project like this, but in this case, we will eventually have several photogates all connected to the same arduino. The problem that could arise is that it might take too long to get through all of our inputs each time we go through the loop, and that could give us some timing inaccuracies.In reality, we'd be just fine in this case, but this is school, where we practice things, so... let's do it both ways!In the polling method, we'll go through each of our gates in order on every loop iteration and note which ones have been blocked or not at any given time.In the interrupt method, we'll make a new interrupt handler for every possible gate pin, and have it update a variable for us that we can look for in the loop function. Then in the loop function we'll report times and stuff.Why would we want to do the extra work for interrupts? Mainly, because they'll almost always end up being more accurate. The arduino has hardware that's watching for changes on the pins in question, and when it sees one it is very quick to report it. Imagine in the polling version, if we just finished checking a pin and then it switched states. We'd have to wait until the rest of our pins were checked, then wait for the stuff all around the loop function to finish, then for our function to get called again and our code to read the pin again. That time sometimes adds up to a significant delay! With the interrupt version, the code that's currently running gets stopped immediately in order to let the interrupt service routine (ISR) handle the interrupt.

Classes are bundles of data with functions attached
The goal is to hide the insides from the rest of the world simplifies big projects by keeping code and data close together
Prevents spaghetti code
Makes updates easier
"object-oriented design"
This is called encapsulation Classes can inherit other class' features (this is called inheritance class Person
class Kid extends Person
You get all of the functions of the parent class, but the data is usually hidden for safety
You can override functions from the parent with your own version, and you can call the parent's version if you want to do that plus some more
Sometimes a parent class leaves a "fill-in-the-blank" function that you have to implement in order to extend it.
Some classes don't have any data, and don't implement any of their own functions. In that case, it's called an interface because all it does is make a promise. Any class that implements my interface will do all of these things
You can put anything in a variable that holds an interface type as long as it implements the interface. This is called polymorphism Programming that's based on encapsulatoin, inheritance, and polymorphism with classes is called Object-oriented because it uses objects as the main idea to organize code. c++
typescript
java
gdscript
python There are other paradigms: functional, imperative, constraint-logic, and other weird ones. Most modern languages are multi-paradigm, which means you can use ideas from more than one of these Basically, just adapt this package.json file, then type npm i:{ "name": "", "type": "module", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "", "scripts": { "build": "npm run build-code &amp;&amp; npm run build-bundle", "build-code": "tsc", "build-bundle": "esbuild build/main.js --sourcemap --bundle --outfile=dist/main.cjs --platform=node --format=cjs", "run": "node dist/main.cjs", "br": "npm run build &amp;&amp; npm run run", "test": "jest" }, "author": "Erik Lee", "license": "MIT", "homepage": "", "devDependencies": { "@babel/preset-env": "^7.25.4", "@babel/preset-typescript": "^7.24.7", "@jest/globals": "^29.7.0", "@types/node": "^22.5.4", "esbuild": "^0.23.1", "jest": "^29.7.0", "typescript": "^5.6.2" }, "dependencies": { "source-map-support": "^0.5.21" }
}
jest is a javascript test framework that makes it easy to test small parts of your code. You have to install it along with babel:npm i --save-dev @jest/globals
npm i --save-dev @babel/preset-env
npm i --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
Here's how it works:// first you have to import the functions you'll need
import {test,expect} from '@jest/globals'; // Now you make tests
// first call test("a description of your test", () =&gt; {a function that does the testing}) test("Make sure true things are still true", () =&gt; { // expect is a function that takes a value and returns a test object. The test // object has a ton of methods that check different things about the value, like // equality to other values, truthiness, definedness, etc. So you call expect on // the value, then tell it how to check to see if it's what you wanted. expect(true===true).toBeTruthy();
})

How to build a map in a robot's brain Your tanks now have..... RADAR! RADAR is RAdio Distance And Range, by the way. Today, we're writing code that will let the tank use the radar to explore its environment.When your tank gets started now, you'll have some new data in the sensors structure. At the moment, it only tells you when it finds a wall, and how far the wall is from you. Here's how it works:
If there is no wall detected, sensors.wall is -1
If a wall is detected, sensors.wall has the distance to the wall, in the direction that the radar is currently pointing. You'll have to use sensors.radar_angle to get that part.
The radar angle is always relative to the direction the tank is pointed, so you'll want to add them together to see where the wall actually is.
The radar doesn't tell you which way the wall is oriented! You have to figure that out using two or more points along the wall, which you can then subtract from each other to get a direction vector
This "radar" is actually pretty similar in its capabilities to your ultrasonic sensors, or a lidar sensor. For game reasons, the radar can differentiate friend from foe and also identify when it's bouncing off of terrain, but a real sensor wouldn't do that.
Controls.turn_radar is active, and accepts a positive or negative angular velocity. Positive indicates clockwise. The maximum turn speed is Controls.turn_gun is active, similar to turn_radar. It's maximum speed is The turret has a simple representation in the window now, so you can see which way it's pointing
The radar sweep can be visible if you set Controls.show_radar to true
You can output messages to the screen using TankAPI.println. Any numbers your give it will automatically be limited to three decimal places, and the output refreshes every frame
You can pause, single-step, and resume the simulation, both by pressing a button on the page, and by calling api.pause() from within your code. This makes it a lot easier to see what's happening Since we have a tank with sensors now, we might consider having some other kinds of data about the world:
Color sensor. Your tank gets a paint gun that can mark various colors on the ground, and it can sense the color of the ground beneath it.
Field strength. Your tank can sense some kind of field that varies in strength. It could be a smell, an electric field, etc. Message relay. You can send messages to other tanks in your team, maybe to coordinate actions? What if your tank had a limited number of beacons that it could fire from the gun? The beacon sticks to whatever it hits, and from that point on you always know the direction and distance to it.
A limited boost to double your speed for a short time
Shooting down other tanks' bullets
A cargo spot, for games like capture the flag. The tank can pick something up and carry it around. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sensor-based%20control" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sensor-based%20control" target="_self">Youtube search for "Sensor-based control"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SLAM%20-%20Simultaneous%20Localization%20and%20Mapping" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SLAM%20-%20Simultaneous%20Localization%20and%20Mapping" target="_self">Youtube search for "SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What%20is%20localization?" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What%20is%20localization?" target="_self">Youtube search for "What is localization?"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20build%20a%20map%20in%20a%20robot's%20brain" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20build%20a%20map%20in%20a%20robot's%20brain" target="_self">Youtube search for "How to build a map in a robot's brain"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (programming) Make your tank drive around the arena using the radar to sense where the walls are. <a data-href="2025-02-26" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-26</a>

What do we do?? We have to change our thinking about how the turn works, and consider it from the angle, "what can I do right now to get closer to my goal?"The answer to that question, of course, is, "turn a little bit." It's pretty easy to make your tank turn a little bit each iteration: just set the controls so that it turns! Sadly, that's not the hard part. The hard part is actually two hard parts: Deciding which direction to turn, and knowing when to stop. Let's take a look at the first problem first.This seems pretty easy, but there's a wrinkle that's actually kind of subtle to overcome: angles have a discontinuity at zero. There are two representations for the angle at that point: either 0, or any number times . That causes a problem for code that just subtracts the starting point from the ending point and goes that way, because to get from down to 0, the simple code will make you turn (the entire 270) angle rather than going the other direction, which is only .So, we're going to have to adjust the angles somehow. We want to end up with our orientation matching the target angle, so the best thing to do is to adjust our starting angle (instead of the target angle, which may seem more natural). We need to have a way to detect that this adjustment is needed, so what does that look like?If you think about turns for a bit, you'll see that there should never be a need to turn by more than , or . So if you subtract target - current and get an angle larger than that, you need to make the adjustment.if(Math.abs(target_angle - current_angle) &gt; Math.PI) { // make some kind of adjustment to the angles
}
Okay, so we know when to do it, but how do we adjust the angle? What's the actual problem here? The problem is that we're using positive or negative angles to represent different directions of turn, but because we have that discontinuity, the closest turn isn't always the right sign. Switching the order of the subtration doesn't work either, because the difference is still the same size! What we need to do is realize that there are actually two different turns we're representing here, clockwise and counterclockwise. A clockwise turn makes the angle larger, while a counterclockwise turn makes it smaller (until it wraps around of course). So, we could just calculate the angle for each kind of turn and pick the smallest one. Let's make a function that computes the clockwise turn angle between two directions. First off, we need to make sure that our target and starting angles are between 0 and , so if the target angle is negative add until it's positive. We'll want to do this whether we're turning left or right; it's called normalizing our data (making it "normal" in the sense that we know its bounds and any weird values are adjusted so they don't break our algorithm).If I want to turn clockwise, that means the target angle has to be larger than the starting angle. Since I want to make my adjustments to the starting angle, I can subtract from it to make sure the target angle is the larger of the two. This will make my starting angle, negative, so when I subtract it from the target angle, I'll end up with a positive turn, which is clockwise. Now we can do the counterclockwise turn version in a similar way. In this case, we want to turn in order to make our angle smaller, so that means the starting angle needs to be larger than the ending angle. If it isn't already, we can just add and it will be. Now when we subtract the end from the start, we'll have a positive number and we'll be making a counterclockwise turn.function clockwise_turn(from_angle:number, to_angle:number):number { if(to_angle &gt; from_angle) { from_angle += 2*Math.PI; } return to_angle - from_angle;
}
function counterclockwise_turn(from_angle:number, to_angle:number):number { if(to_angle &lt; from_angle) { from_angle -= 2*Math.PI; } return to_angle - from_angle;
}
Now we can just call each of those functions and pick the smallest magnitude of turn:function turn_toward(from_angle: number, to_angle:number) { let ccw = counterclockwise_turn(from_angle,to_angle); // get the angle for a right turn let turn = clockwise_turn(from_angle,to_angle); // default to the left turn angle if(Math.abs(ccw) &lt; Math.abs(turn)) { // switch to the right turn if it's better turn = ccw; } // now do our turning control
}
Stopping at the right moment is another challenge. The problem is that our max turning speed is pretty fast, so we're likely to overshoot and end up turning too far if we just do the "turn at full speed until our angle is close enough" strategy. We need to be a bit smarter.The real problem is only on the last step of our turn! That's the place where we are likely to turn too far - otherwise, we can go max speed and be just fine. So how do you know when you're on the last step? You have to predict where you're going to end up and check to see if it's too far. If it is, you scale back your speed so that you just exactly finish the turn in the time allotted.Predicting where you'll end up means you have to know your turning rate (angular velocity) as well as the amount of time you'll have before the next iteration where you can stop. Fortunately, we have a delta_t variable handy, and we can figure out our turning rate from the tank's max track speed and wheelbase (using our differential steering math from earlier). So, the code that knows when to stop turning looks like this:let max_turn_speed = track_speed/(wheel_base/2); // assume tracks going in opposite directions to turn in place
if(turn &lt; delta_t * max_turn_speed) { // We want to have a turn that gets us exactly to the right place, so we // set the speed to be that number of radians per second. One delta_t spent at this // speed should turn us by exactly the amount of angle we need! max_turn_speed = turn/delta_t; }
This is going to be part of your homework, but it is very similar to the section above about knowing when to stop. You can cruise along at max speed right up until your next move at that speed would take you too far, then scale it back so you end up in the right place. Fortunately for us, our tanks don't currently have any inertia to worry about, so they can stop in zero distance!Now that the assignment's done, here's an example of what we came up with:import { TankAPI, Controls, Sensors } from './tank-api'; const max_speed: number = 10;
const wheel_base: number = 20;
var steps: ((api: TankAPI) =&gt; boolean)[]; function stop(controls: Controls) { controls.left_track_speed = 0; controls.right_track_speed = 0;
} export function setup() { steps = [ move_builder(300), ];
} export function loop(api: TankAPI) { let controls = api.getControls(); console.log(`delta_t = ${api.getDeltaT()}`); if (steps.length &gt; 0) { if (steps[0](api)) { steps.shift(); }; } api.setControls(controls);
} function move_builder(distance: number): (api: TankAPI) =&gt; boolean { let moved_already = 0; return (api: TankAPI) =&gt; { let controls = api.getControls(); if (Math.abs(moved_already - distance) &lt; 0.01) { stop(controls); return true; } let speed = (distance - moved_already) / api.getDeltaT(); if (speed &gt; max_speed) { speed = max_speed; console.log(`speed limit: ${speed}`) } else { console.log(`no speed limit, speed=${speed}`) } moved_already += speed * api.getDeltaT(); controls.left_track_speed = speed; controls.right_track_speed = speed; return false; }
} Inertia and slipping are real-world things that we definitely have to deal with in robotics code, but they're also really complicated and difficult to predict. In order to handle this problem, there's an entire discipline called Control System Engineering that creates algorithms that adapt to errors in order to correct them rather than making perfect predictive movements. The control system we'll be starting out with is the simplest one: proportional control. The basic idea of this is that your control input (the speed setting, or how much change you can make) is proportional to how far you are from the target. If you're a long way off, you should move faster. If you're right next to it, you should make smaller changes.In the tanks, this would amount to using our error as a multiplier to figure out our speed (whether it's turning or moving, the process is the same). A big error means a big speed is fine, but a small error should slow us down. The only thing that proportional control adds to that idea is that we need some kind of scale factor to use along with the error. The scale factor is just a number that kind of wraps up all of the little details of our system - how powerful the control is, how sluggish the response is, etc. etc. We don't have to compute the scale factor, instead we find it by "tuning" our controller until it gives us the best performance. That process just means that we run lots of trials and adjust this extra multiplier up and down until we find a sweet spot where it works the best.This kind of control has problems: it's very slow to converge on the right value, it can end up oscillating around the target, and it doesn't deal with things like persisten errors (imagine a ship being blown off course by a wind, there would be a constant error that the proportional control wouldn't handle well). These extra problems are handled by adding more components to our control signal (the Integral and Derivative, to be specific), but we'll get to those later.

A class is a kind of thing - they don't actually exist until you make an instance
Classes can also be variations of other classes Inheritance - I'm a cat, but also an animal
Do everything the superclass does, but maybe with a few changes and some extra features
Child class has the parent class inside like a nesting doll In programming, a class makes a new type. You know types from other variables: they are things like int and string
You can't ever just have an int - you always have a particular int like 7.
The same thing applies to classes, when you create one, you have an object, whose type is the class it came from An object or instance of a class can act like itself or any of its ancestor classes, because it has all of them embedded into itself
This lets you do things like have an array of Pet, where each item is actually a Dog,Cat,Bird, or other pet object. None of them are actually instances of just Pet, but all of them know how to do Pet stuff!
The class keyword is used to create a new class in typescript. It'll look like this:class Cat extends Animal { breed: string constructor(kingdom:string,phylum:string,class_:string,order:string,family:string,genus:string,species:string,breed:string) { super(kingdom,phylum,class_,order,family,genus,species); this.breed = breed; } meow():string { return "MRowl" }
}
Remember Kids Playing Chess On Freeways Get Squashed? (Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species...)Anyway, there are a few things in this class to notice.
extends tells the class that a Cat is a kind of Animal. This means that the cat gets to have all of the features of the Animal class, and it can override them or add new ones as you wish.
constructor is a special function that gets called whenever you make a new cat, which looks like let my_cat = new Cat("animal",...) (extra args left as an exercise for the reader...)
Member functions or Methods, like meow in the example, don't need the function keyword. Just put the name of the function, its arg list, and the return type.
Member variables, like breed, are declared inside the class but not inside a function. They don't need a var or let keyword. These become values that you can use anywhere inside the class' code. They're part of the cat, so any cat function can see them. Design a class hierarchy for pets All pets are animals
Some pets are mammals, some reptiles, some avian
What things can each particular type of pet do that others may not?
What can all animals do?
What can all birds do? Design a class hierarchy for vehicles Cars, trucks, trains, bicycles, planes, spaceships, cargo ships

If you're importing something that you installed with npm:// If you have the readline package, it gets imported like this:

An interface is a promise you can make that says that any object that implements it can do some things. That lets you pass all kinds of different things around that have something in common, and use the common feature to get stuff done.interface Pet { name():string; // returns true if that was enough food... feed(food_amount: number): bool;
} /// Now you can make a class that implements the interface

In typescript, instead of declaring a function virtual, it's called abstract and they aren't quite the same thing. in c++, a virtual function is one that can be redefined by a subclass, and a pure virtual function (one that has 0 after it) must be defined by a subclass
in typescript, all functions can be redefined by a subclass, and you use abstract to mark a function as being what you'd call pure virtual in c++. In typescript, method functions have to be defined in the class declaration itself. In c++, you have to put the function definitions into a separate file to prevent multiple definition errors.
The type syntax is different, naturally
You never have to worry about calling delete on anything in typescript, because it's a garbage-collected language: the system that runs your program takes care of cleaning up memory that you're no longer using.
With that in mind, let's make a typescript state machine today!Here's a sketch of what it looks like with classes:
// Just like in our differential steering robot state machine, the robot itself is
// the state machine. It passes the control structure to the different states so
// that they can control the movement and firing of the gun, and whatever other
// things the robot needs to do. If we end up with a lot of information in the
// Robot class (like keeping track of our position and plan), then we'll pass that
// into the states along with the API so that they're all working from the same
// data. class Robot { constructor(init_state:string = "init") { this.current_state = init_state; this.states = { "init": new Init(), }; } update(dt:number, api:TankAPI) { let new_state = this.states[current_state].update(dt,api); this.switchTo(new_state,api); } // When we switch to a new state, the new state might *also* want to switch in // order to make an epsilon transition. This is where that happens in a recursive // call to switchTo. switchTo looks for the special state name "no-change" to // indicate that it should do nothing, so don't name any of your states // "no-change"! switchTo(new_state_name: string,api:TankAPI) { if(new_state_name == "no-change") { // if the state wants to stay active, //this is the "new state" it should return. return; } this.states[this.current_state].leave(api); // leave the state we were in this.current_state = new_state_name; // update the state name let epsilon = this.states[new_state_name].enter(api); // enter the new state this.switchTo(epsilon,api); // implement the epsilon transition if there is one. } current_state: string states: {[key:string], State}
} // State is an "abstract" class, meaning that it's declared so that you can never
// actually instantiate one. Instead, you have to make subclasses of it, and then
// you can instantiate *them*. This is just here to describe what *all* States can
// do.
// // // When you write these states, think of them as being the behaviors of your tank.
// Whenever it's in a particular state, it's *doing something particular to that
// state*. You might end up with more than one state machine! You could easily have
// one for driving and a separate one for fire-control, and maybe even a third for
// plan-setting. They all use the Robot as a place to store their information, and
// that's what lets them work together. class State { // this is called for every input event or frame of the simulation. abstract update(dt:number, api: TankAPI):string; // The enter function can cause a state transition too, so that we can have // "epsilon" transitions. by default, it tells the state machine NOT to change // states immediately. enter(api: TankAPI):string { return "no-change"; } leave(api: TankAPI) { }
} // This is just an example of an Init state, yours will probably be very different.
// In this case, the Init state just makes sure the tank isn't moving and then
// returns. You'll likely want to have this state be the default "drive around
// hunting" state, or make an epsilon transition to that state by returning its
// name from the `enter` method. class Init extends State { update(dt:number, api:TankAPI):string { // nothing to see here... For now, this class doesn't have anywhere to go, // so this function doesn't do anything. All we need to do is return the // "no-change" value to let the state machine know that it should keep // being in the Init state: return "no-change"; } // When we enter the Init state, we should make sure to set all of the controls // of our tank to be stopped. enter(api: TankAPI) : string { let controls = api.getControls(); controls.left_speed = 0; controls.right_speed = 0; controls.radar_turn = 0; controls.gun_turn = 0; controls.fire_gun = 0; api.setControls(controls); return "no-change"; } // Nothing in particular to do when we leave, so we don't even have to write // that function! It has a default definition in the State class, so we'll just // skip it here.
}
<br>You can also do a switch-style state machine in typescript, and it looks very similar to the one from <a data-href="implementing-state-machines-cpp" href="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/implementing-state-machines-cpp.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">implementing-state-machines-cpp</a>, except that you can just use strings for the state names and skip the part about making the enum if you want. The same tradeoffs apply here as in c++.
What is the purpose of the State class in this setup? Why is it even there?
When do you think you might want to have more than one state machine controlling your tank?
When I say, "Each state is a behavior," what does that mean? Give some examples of "behaviors" that make sense here. <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (programming) Implement your driving in a square navigation as a state machine in typescript. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/typescript-state-machine" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/typescript-state-machine" target="_self">Example code here</a> <a data-href="2025-03-24" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-03-24</a>

We'll represent this as hit points, and they will be another part of the Tank class on the server. The sensor data should also contain the current tank's health, and the health of any enemy tanks that are scanned by the radar.When a tank's hit points are zero or less, the tank is destroyed. At that point, it should be removed from the update cycle, but the tank's dead body should stay on the field to be used as cover. A dead tank can still collide with bullets and other tanks
A dead tank returns a radar signature as usual
A dead tank's drive velocity, gun angle and radar angle are all fixed at zero
A dead tank can take any amount of damage without further destruction (for now)
A dead tank can be pushed by other tanks! For this purpose, it should just act like a rock as far as the physics is concerned. We'll need to have a coefficient of friction and a mass set A dead tank's graphic on-screen should show that it's dead somehow, maybe with a different color or fill.
The bullets already have a damage function, so we just need to call that when a bullet hits a tank, and apply the result to the tank. If we plan ahead for different armor types, we want to know not only the bullet's damage, but also where it came from (in case armor is unequally distributed on the tank). The tank's damage function should take a number and a direction.
May be fun to add some knockback: higher power bullets apply larger impulse.
When a tank crashes into something, it should take damage. Once again, the damage should depend on not only the absolute amount, but the direction. Most tanks should have tougher armor on the front so that they can ram other tanks and end up winning.Damage from a collision should depend on the relative velocity at impact. It needs to be a kinetic energy approximation, so that faster hits have damage that grows quadratically.On collision, the damage is applied to both sides equally, but the tank itself applies its directional armor before deducting hit points.Code will go here when we finish the coding session today]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/writing-tank-damage.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/writing-tank-damage.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[catworld-simulator]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a program that we will use to explore state machines.

It wouldn't actually matter if they went 0 to 360, because the underlying problem of a big discontinuity would still be there. This is very annoying to deal with when you're writing orientation code.So, how can you make it less painful? The central problem comes in trying to interpolate between values that cross the discontinuity where 180 = -180, because any kind of numerical interpolation will not see those as adjacent values, and you'll end up spinning around the long way rather than taking the "natural" sub-180-degree turn.Straight forward is defined as 0, left is 90, right is -90. If you're between -90 and -180, but you wanted to be at 90, then the natural thing is to subtract the start from the finish and interpolate through that range. However, -100 (target) minus 90 (start) is -190, and that's more than 180 degrees so you're going the wrong way! You should never need to turn by more than 180 degrees (otherwise, you should have turned the other direction).To solve the problem, you have to make sure your current angle and target angle are measured from zero in the same direction (clockwise or counter clockwise; negative or positive angle, etc). If they are, then your current angle is the one that's off the mark and it will need to be adjusted so that interpolation can run smoothly. The thing that's actually hapening here is this:
The current and target angles have incompatible representations. One of them is a clockwise rotation, and the other is counterclockwise.
In order to interpolate between them, they have to be the same kind of rotation
Changing the representation of the current angle means that you'll always end up with your final current angle in the right representation (after the turn is complete, current angle will be equal to the desired target angle instead of the opposite representation of it).
Here's how to do the turn:
Subtract . If that answer has a magnitude greater than 180, then just interpolating the turn from current to target will take the long way around, so you need to flip the sign of the starting angle.
To flip the sign: If starting angle is positive, subtract 360
If starting angle is negative, add 360 The equivalent mathy way is do The reason you should adjust the current angle instead of the target is that you want to end up with your angle being equal to the target value, as specified. Otherwise, you can end up accumulating a huge angular value because you're adding 360 every time without ever correcting it back down. Changing the representation of the current angle so that it matches the target angle avoids that problem.Examples:Target angle: 90
current angle: -120
target - current: The turn is too large, and current angle is negative, so I add 360: . Now I can interpolate naturally from 240 to 90 (a -150 degree turn)Target angle: -90
current angle: 110
target - current: The turn is too large, and current angle is positive, so I subtract 360: 110-360=-250$. Now I can go smoothly from -250 to -90 (a positive 160-degree turn)]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/dealing-wtih-relative-turn-angles.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/dealing-wtih-relative-turn-angles.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[line-counter]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your mission: Write a program that reads data from a file, counts the number of lines it finds, and prints the result to the console.

Shooting with more power does more damage, but requires a longer recharge.Give the guns a recharge rate. Every frame, that much energy gets replaced. The gun can only fire with the firing energy is full, so the more you use for your shot, the longer it takes to recharge before you can shoot again.In jsbattle, the bullets all went the same speed. I think it might be fun to play with having the speed depend on the power of the shot. That would let targeted tanks prioritize which shots to dodge, and it would also add some tactical fun - a well-designed sequence might fire several shots while driving through an arc, so that the shots will all hit the same spot at the same instant. Kinetic energy = , so I can just use that. The speed difference will be the square root of the energy difference, so it won't be a huge gap.The bullet needs to be a small Body with isSensor set to be true. It will have to make itself disappear when it collides with something (including the arena walls). Each bullet will have velocity and position included by matter-js, so that's really all I have to worry about. An alternative way to do it would be to just use a little sprite to show the position of the bullet, and cast a ray that goes:
behind its current position
along its flight path
the amount of distance that the bullet flew this timestep
That would give me approximate continuous collision detection with other things that aren't bullets. To be able to shoot bullets out of the air, I'd have to have the full collision bodies.I think it would be awesome to be able to shoot down other bullets. A perfectly-aimed and timed shot should eliminate a threat.It could be interesting (fun?) to make the gun's range depend on the shot power. The damage is always based on the shot energy, but the speed of the bullet could also be (and it could be done so that the kinetic energy is what determines both)Matter-js already includes air resistance, I think it might be interesting to have that turned on. It would complicate nearly everything, so maybe that's only in advanced levels (the game could take place on asteroids or something until later, when they get to a planet with an atmosphere).]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/tank-shooting.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/tank-shooting.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[tank-url-fetch]]></title><description><![CDATA[Goal: Let the users put their code in a github repo and fetch fresh versions whenever it changes.

Go into your homework directory and run the command: git clone https://github.com/aethertap/typescript-template hw1
Enter the hw1 directory and type npm i
Type npm run br If it prints a bunch of stuff then ends up with "It works." you're good to go.
If there are problems, let me know. The starting point for your program will be in src/app.ts, but you can add other files and import them as needed. For now, app.ts is probably all you'll need. Remember to export your functions so that they can be called in the tests
Remember that a new line can only be inserted in a string by using the \n character (that is a BACKslash, not the one by the question mark!) What do these loops print?
for(let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 2) { console.log(i);
}
for(let i = 100; i &gt;= 0; i = i - 7) { console.log(i);
}
for(let i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1) { console.log(i);
}
for(let i = 2; i &lt; 100; i = i * 2) { console.log(i);
} Write a function called squares to print the numbers from 1 to 10 and their squares: 1	1 2	4 3	9 ... 10	100 Write a function called star_triangle that generates a string that looks like the star triangle below, and returns it to the caller. The function should take one argument, which is the number of lines that the triangle should include (so star_triangle(3) would return a triangle with 1 star, 2 stars, and finally 3 stars). * ** *** **** ***** ****** ******* ******** ********* **********
Don't use ten printf statements; use two nested loops instead. You'll have to use braces around the body of the outer loop if it contains multiple statements:	for(let i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1) { /* multiple statements */ /* can go in here */ }
(Hint: a string you hand to printf does not have to contain the newline character \n.)]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/triangle-of-stars.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/programming/programming-projects/triangle-of-stars.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[types-and-comparisons]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Classes are bundles of data with functions attached
The goal is to hide the insides from the rest of the world simplifies big projects by keeping code and data close together
Prevents spaghetti code
Makes updates easier
"object-oriented design"
This is called encapsulation Classes can inherit other class' features (this is called inheritance class Person
class Kid extends Person
You get all of the functions of the parent class, but the data is usually hidden for safety
You can override functions from the parent with your own version, and you can call the parent's version if you want to do that plus some more
Sometimes a parent class leaves a "fill-in-the-blank" function that you have to implement in order to extend it.
Some classes don't have any data, and don't implement any of their own functions. In that case, it's called an interface because all it does is make a promise. Any class that implements my interface will do all of these things
You can put anything in a variable that holds an interface type as long as it implements the interface. This is called polymorphism Programming that's based on encapsulatoin, inheritance, and polymorphism with classes is called Object-oriented because it uses objects as the main idea to organize code. c++
typescript
java
gdscript
python There are other paradigms: functional, imperative, constraint-logic, and other weird ones. Most modern languages are multi-paradigm, which means you can use ideas from more than one of these Basically, just adapt this package.json file, then type npm i:{ "name": "", "type": "module", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "", "scripts": { "build": "npm run build-code &amp;&amp; npm run build-bundle", "build-code": "tsc", "build-bundle": "esbuild build/main.js --sourcemap --bundle --outfile=dist/main.cjs --platform=node --format=cjs", "run": "node dist/main.cjs", "br": "npm run build &amp;&amp; npm run run", "test": "jest" }, "author": "Erik Lee", "license": "MIT", "homepage": "", "devDependencies": { "@babel/preset-env": "^7.25.4", "@babel/preset-typescript": "^7.24.7", "@jest/globals": "^29.7.0", "@types/node": "^22.5.4", "esbuild": "^0.23.1", "jest": "^29.7.0", "typescript": "^5.6.2" }, "dependencies": { "source-map-support": "^0.5.21" }
}
jest is a javascript test framework that makes it easy to test small parts of your code. You have to install it along with babel:npm i --save-dev @jest/globals
npm i --save-dev @babel/preset-env
npm i --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
Here's how it works:// first you have to import the functions you'll need
import {test,expect} from '@jest/globals'; // Now you make tests
// first call test("a description of your test", () =&gt; {a function that does the testing}) test("Make sure true things are still true", () =&gt; { // expect is a function that takes a value and returns a test object. The test // object has a ton of methods that check different things about the value, like // equality to other values, truthiness, definedness, etc. So you call expect on // the value, then tell it how to check to see if it's what you wanted. expect(true===true).toBeTruthy();
})

It will not work!
import * as thestuff from './path/to/thestuff';
If you're importing something that you installed with npm:// If you have the readline package, it gets imported like this:
import * as readline from 'nodegui';
// If it's from another source, you sometimes need to specify the source:
import * as nodegui from '@nodegui/nodegui';
class MyNewClass { my_data: number my_name: string constructor(data: number, a_name_to_use: string) { this.my_data = data this.my_name = a_name_to_use } some_func(cool_numbers: number[]): bool { // do something cool that returns a bool }
} // if you want to extend a class
class Dog extends Animal{ my_name: string constructor(has_feet: bool, name: string) { super(has_feet); // initialize the Animal base class this.my_name = name; //initialize myself }
}
An interface is a promise you can make that says that any object that implements it can do some things. That lets you pass all kinds of different things around that have something in common, and use the common feature to get stuff done.interface Pet { name():string; // returns true if that was enough food... feed(food_amount: number): bool;
} /// Now you can make a class that implements the interface
class Dog implements Pet { name():string { return this.my_name; } }

The kids are struggling with some of the material, and it's my responsibility to get them to the point of understanding on the most efficient path.On the days when I feel like I've really nailed it, there are a few things that are always true:
I had a clear plan for what to show them and how to do it. There was no scramble to quickly review what they're learning and try to make up examples on the whiteboard.
I had extra resources ready - videos, experiments, practice problems
I had energy that I could project into the lesson
They were awake and alert
On the other hand, my worst days generally fall into a simple pattern: Failure to plan and exhaustion.I need to make sure I always have a plan for the day. I need to explain, then have them do guided practice with immediate feedback, and finally give them problems to work on independently.In class there should be explanation and guided practice. I should not be having them do their homework as part of the class.I need to make sure they are taking useful notes. Notes are useful when they create connections and support creating practice flashcards, and when they clearly lay-out both how and why when that applies (like physics or math).In order to consistently have a plan, I'm going to have to establish a routine with as close to zero resistance built-in as possible. Go to the school room in the morning
Use a lesson template with a form to make sure you don't forget to add important pieces. Each subject needs its own template with specific requirements
I need to have a dashboard page with auto-generated links to create lessons in the right places for the day in question. It should be able to work into the future. Read the lesson material
If there are exercises, pick three to do in class and work them out ahead of time with clear, separated steps with explanations. Copy and paste existing examples whenever possible! I want this to be digital, which means I can't be trying to type it in latex math notation because it's too slow. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://webdemo.myscript.com/views/math/index.html#" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://webdemo.myscript.com/views/math/index.html#" target="_self">Handwriting to latex online processor</a>
I installed a Latex snippet tool in obsidian to help Add extra resource links
Send lesson notes to kids (rsync, make it part of the syncup script)
Assign problems for guided practice to be done in class while I watch Pick one problem from each type that's in the assignment, have them do that while I hover and make corrections Assign problems for homework
Add some fun (jokes, videos, whatever I can dig up)

Short-response questions about all subjects
Long-form writing occasionally about particular subjects
Writing work needs to be easier to turn in and grade Math is self-contained and well-organized by the textbook already, no changes needed The only problem is grading, but doing the grading on off-days with the kids seems to work pretty well. They get more benefit from it, and I get the grading done reliably. Physics/science: Physics needs an outline so that I can plan labs, assignments, and know what to teach.
I need to add experiments that fit with the topics
I need to add some crash-course level stuff for reviewing all of the basic concepts of scientific investigation and facts about the world
The lightning round needs to have a calculator so we can see the running score.
I need to have consistent homework assignments with solveable problems.
things need to be graded Engineering I need to develop the big-picture of where we're going with the projects
We need to have a project plan with deadlines
We need to get the bots driving and following lines Programming We need to do a lot more small-exercises to work with basic code structures Use fill-in-the-blank scaffolded code exercises, where the main part of the code is already written, but important pieces are left as an exercise and clearly marked. I need an outline of the simple skills we're going to build through the process. Maybe a published course can help here History History is a train wreck, I need to add a LOT more outside material. Some of this can be part of the reading journal.
The kids need to be writing about their own analysis of the events of history.
I need to develop some reliable short-form prompts that I can drop in for any topic. Language/grammar This is going well enough, but the rest of the BFLAN needs to be planned out in one big file so that I don't have to remember to do it every week.
Create due dates for each BFLAN topic. ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/school-plan.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/school-plan.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[motion-outline]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Position: Where an object is located, relative to a reference point. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (distance) and direction [1].
Velocity: The rate at which an object's position changes with time. Its magnitude is speed [1].
Acceleration: The rate at which an object's velocity changes with time. It can involve changes in speed, direction, or both [2].
Mass: A measure of an object's inertia, or resistance to changes in velocity [2].
Force: A push or pull that can cause an object to accelerate. It is a vector quantity [2].
Newton's Laws of Motion (Translational)
First Law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force [3].
Second Law: An object's acceleration is equal to the net force acting on it divided by its mass (F = ma) [4, 5].
Third Law: For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force [6, 7]. Angular Position: An object's orientation relative to a reference orientation [8].
Angular Velocity: The rate at which an object's angular position changes with time [9].
Angular Acceleration: The rate at which an object's angular velocity changes with time [10].
Rotational Mass (Moment of Inertia): A measure of an object's resistance to changes in angular velocity [11].
Torque: A twist or spin that can cause an object to undergo angular acceleration [12].
Newton's Laws of Motion (Rotational)
First Law: A rigid, non-wobbling object not subject to any outside torques rotates at a constant angular velocity [12].
Second Law: The net torque acting on a rigid, non-wobbling object is equal to its rotational mass times its angular acceleration (τ = I α) [13].
Third Law: For every torque, there is an equal and opposite reaction torque [14]. Linear Momentum: A measure of an object's translational motion and its resistance to changes in that motion. It is equal to the object's mass times its velocity (p = m v) [15].
Angular Momentum: A measure of an object's rotational motion and its resistance to changes in that motion. It is equal to the object's rotational mass times its angular velocity (L = I ω) [16]. Impulse: The change in an object's momentum due to a force applied over time (Δp = F t) [17].
Angular Impulse: The change in an object's angular momentum due to a torque applied over time (ΔL = τ t) [18]. Work: The transfer of energy to an object by applying a force over a distance or a torque over an angle [19, 20].
Energy: The capacity to do work. It can take various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, and others [21]. Force and Acceleration: Force is the cause of acceleration, and acceleration requires a force [22].
Torque and Angular Acceleration: Torque is the cause of angular acceleration, and angular acceleration requires a torque [23].
Momentum and Impulse: Changes in momentum are caused by impulses [24].
Angular Momentum and Angular Impulse: Changes in angular momentum are caused by angular impulses [18].
Work and Energy Transfer: Work is a mechanism for transferring energy [21].
Conservation Laws: Energy, momentum, and angular momentum are conserved quantities [15, 21, 25].
Applying a force to a skating object over time changes its momentum, which is a measure of its tendency to keep moving [26].Exerting a torque on a seesaw over time changes its angular momentum, affecting its rotational motion [18].Imagine a mass at the end of a long, massless pole. You are trying to push the mass forward by applying a torque to the opposite end of the pole. in an infinitesimal slice of time, the mass will move a tiny distance forward in a straight path. Therefore, the work done on the mass in that instant is equal to the force applied to it by its end of the lever, times the distance it moved. The force applied at the mass end is scaled down by the length of the lever arm though, due to mechanical advantage.However, its distance of motion is scaled up by exactly the same factor for the same reason. For small angles, sin(x) = x. Since the distance traveled at the end of the lever arm is , defining a torque as and then applying it over angle gives you . Then you get the equation but is torque, and for tiny angles, so it becomes .Springs are elastic, meaning that they can be stretched and will then return to their original shape. The more you deform them, the harder they resist. This leads to Hooke's Law, which says that the restoring force of a spring is proportional to the distance it's been deformed: . is the spring constant, which is a number that basically says "for every distance you stretch the spring, it will be this much harder to keep going." The unit of is , which makes sense (newtons per meter), but it simplifies to the weird unit , which is very non-intuitive.Springs have an elastic limit, which is the point where they can't recover from being deformed any farther. If you moosh a spring past its elastic limit, you will leave a permanent change in it. As long as you stay within the elastic limit, the spring can last essentially forever, barring the effects of other parts of the real world (like corrosion and metal impurities).If you put a weight on the end of a spring and then give it a bump so that it bounces up and down, it will keep bouncing back and forth for quite a while (in a perfectly elastic spring without friction, it would go forever). This is a visual demonstration of conversion back and forth between kinetic energy and elastic potential energy. The kinetic energy of the weight is enough to pull the spring past its neutral point, but the force increases and the weight does work to stretch the spring. That work is stored as elastic potential energy in the spring, and once all of the kinetic energy is spent, that potential energy gets released as the spring returns toward neutral and accelerates the weight in the other direction. However, by the time it gets to neutral again, the weight is going at its top speed, so the cycle just has to repeat in the other direction, and it keeps going until friction kills it.So, what happens with momentum in that situation? Clearly the mass gains momentum as it moves, and the momentum must be transferred somewhere because it's conserved. Where does it come from and where does it go? The answer is simply that it comes from whatever the spring is attached to, and it goes right back there. Imagine that one end of the spring is attached to a massive cannon ball, and the other is attached to a little steel marble. The whole contraption is floating in space. Now you pull the marble to get it moving back and forth. You'll see the marble move much farther than the cannon ball, but both of them will be moving in response to the force from the spring. The cannon ball is moving so slowly and such a small amount that its kinetic energy is barely changing (remember kinetic energy equals the force times the distance moved, which is basically zero here), but its momentum will exactly match the marble's.]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-outline.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-outline.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[physics-2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[2025-04-14: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiment-center-of-mass.md" data-href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiment-center-of-mass.md" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiment-center-of-mass.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">experiment-center-of-mass</a><br>2025-04-11: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiments-1.md" data-href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiments-1.md" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/experiments-1.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">experiments-1</a><br>2025-04-07: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/curved-mirrors-and-thin-lenses.md" data-href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/curved-mirrors-and-thin-lenses.md" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/curved-mirrors-and-thin-lenses.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">curved-mirrors-and-thin-lenses</a><br>2025-03-31: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/image-formation.md" data-href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/image-formation.md" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/image-formation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">image-formation</a><br>2025-03-28: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/total-internal-reflection.md" data-href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/total-internal-reflection.md" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/total-internal-reflection.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">total-internal-reflection</a><br><a data-href="lesson-index" href="projects/school-fall-2024/lesson-index.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">lesson-index</a><br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="five-easy-lessons-notes" data-href="five-easy-lessons-notes" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/five-easy-lessons-notes.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Teaching strategy notes</a> from Five Easy LessonsPlease generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in section number.

Sketch the situation, showing the objects at the beginning and end of motion, and at any points in between where the nature of motion changes (like where the acceleration changes)
Establish a coordinate system, and label the axes and origin with their meanings
Add symbols to represent time, position, and velocity of each object for each time at which you've shown the object. Use subscripts to distinguish different times and objects. Include symbols for the geometry of the problem. Every variable used later should have a representation on the drawing, even if its value is known from the start.
Draw arrows to show the acceleration of the object between each positionand the next in your sketch (or write ). Make sure they are consistent with the motion diagram!
Make a table listing all of the symbols that are known from the problem statement or that can be easily deduced from simple geometry. Check that your signs are consistent with the motion diagram and the coordinate system. Do any unit conversions that are needed as you are filling in the table.
Add known relationships between the symbols to the table as well, for example if , put that in the table
Make a list of the unknown quantities that you'll need in order to answer the question
The purpose of this is to make it as easy as possible to choose which kinematic equations are appropriate, and to ensure that you get the right bits of data into them with the right signs.

The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving topics.
Physics quiz <a data-href="2025-01-07" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-01-07</a> What physical property does a spring scale actually measure when you step onto the platform? Why would this probably be different on a different planet?
What is the name of the position a spring is in when it is not being deformed by stretching or compression?
What is Hooke's Law? Give the formula and explain what it means.
You stretch a spring 4 cm and record a tension of 100N. What is the spring constant for this spring? Make sure you include units
What is the name of the force that a spring exerts to get back to its equilibrium position?
What does the term centripetal force mean, and what kind of motion does it help us describe?
What is the formula for centripetal force, both in terms of speed and of angular speed?
A satellite in geostationary orbit will orbit at a speed that keeps it above the same point on earth at all times. The distance to the center of the earth at this height is about 39,000 km. The acceleration due to gravity is only because it is so far above the surface. What is the satellite's centripetal acceleration in this orbit? How fast must it be moving?
When you first let go of a bowling ball, it’s not rotating. But as it slides down the alley, it begins to rotate. Use the concept of energy to explain why the ball’s forward speed decreases as it begins to spin.
You want to drop a 1 kg weight onto a nail in order to drive it into a block of wood. On your first try, you drop it from a height of 1 meter but the nail only goes in 1 cm. If you start with a new nail, from how high would you need to drop the weight in order to drive it 4 cm deep? How much faster would the weight be moving when it hit from this new height?
If you throw a ball upward at a velocity of 64 ft/s, how long will it take for it to reach its highest point? How high will it be at that time?
Here is a six-question quiz about momentum and energy, drawing on information from chapters 1-3 of the source:
Question 1: A pitcher throws a 0.5 kg baseball at 10 m/s. What is the baseball's momentum? Answer: Momentum is the product of mass and velocity: 0.5 kg 10 m/s = **5 kgm/s** Question 2: A 2-kg bowling ball is moving at 4 m/s. How much kinetic energy does it have? Answer: Kinetic energy is found using the equation: 1/2 mass speed^2. So, the bowling ball has 1/2 2 kg (4 m/s)^2 = 16 J of kinetic energy. Question 3: A 1-kg cart is rolling at 2 m/s. It collides with a stationary 1-kg cart and they stick together. How fast are the two carts moving after the collision? Answer: Momentum is conserved in a collision. The momentum before the collision is 1 kg * 2 m/s = 2 kg m/s. After the collision, the combined mass is 2 kg, and the momentum is still 2 kg m/s. Therefore, the velocity is 2 kg m/s / 2 kg = 1 m/s. Question 4: You drop a 1-kg rock from a height of 2 meters. What is its velocity just before it hits the ground? Answer: Neglecting air resistance, the rock's gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy is mass acceleration due to gravity height = 1 kg 9.8 m/s^2 2 m = 19.6 J. This becomes the kinetic energy just before impact. Using the kinetic energy formula (1/2 mass speed^2 = 19.6 J), and solving for speed, we get speed = (2*19.6 J / 1 kg)^1/2 = 6.26 m/s. Question 5: A 0.1 kg tennis ball is traveling at 20 m/s. A tennis racket hits the ball and sends it back in the opposite direction at 30 m/s. What is the magnitude of the impulse delivered to the ball? Answer: The magnitude of the impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the tennis ball. Initially, the ball's momentum is 0.1 kg 20 m/s = 2 kgm/s. After being hit, its momentum is 0.1 kg (-30 m/s) = -3 kgm/s (note the negative sign for the change in direction). The change in momentum, and therefore the magnitude of the impulse, is 2 kgm/s - (-3 kgm/s) = 5 kg*m/s. Question 6: A child pushes a 5-kg sled across frictionless ice with a force of 10 N for a distance of 2 m. How much work did the child do on the sled? Answer: The work done is equal to the force applied times the distance over which the force is applied. In this case, the work is 10 N * 2 m = 20 J. This information is from the sources provided. You may want to independently verify this information.Here is a six-question quiz about torque, rotational energy, angular momentum, rolling, and rotation, drawing on information from chapter 2 of the source:
Question 1: A mechanic applies a force of 5 N to a wrench that is 0.2 m long. What is the torque applied to the bolt? Answer: Torque is the product of the force and the lever arm. So the torque is 5 N 0.2 m = **1 Nm**. Question 2: A 1-kg solid disk with a radius of 0.1 m is rotating at 2 radians per second. What is its rotational kinetic energy? Answer: A solid disk has a rotational mass of 1/2 mass radius^2 = 1/2 1 kg (0.1 m)^2 = 0.005 kgm^2. The rotational kinetic energy is 1/2 rotational mass angular speed^2 = 1/2 0.005 kgm^2 (2 rad/s)^2 = 0.01 J. Question 3: A figure skater has an initial angular momentum of 10 kg*m^2/s. She pulls her arms in, reducing her rotational mass to half its original value. What is her new angular speed? Answer: Angular momentum is conserved. Initially, her angular momentum is 10 kgm^2/s. After pulling her arms in, her angular momentum is still 10 kgm^2/s, but her rotational mass is halved. Therefore, her angular velocity must double to 10 kgm^2/s / (1/2 original rotational mass) = 2 * original angular velocity. Question 4: A bicycle wheel with a radius of 0.3 m is rolling without slipping at a speed of 2 m/s. What is its angular speed? Answer: For an object rolling without slipping, its speed is the product of its angular speed and its radius. Therefore, the angular speed of the wheel is 2 m/s / 0.3 m = 6.67 rad/s. Question 5: You apply a torque of 2 N*m to a flywheel for 5 seconds. What is the angular impulse you delivered to the flywheel? Answer: Angular impulse is the product of torque and the time interval over which it acts. So the angular impulse is 2 Nm 5 s = 10 Nms. Question 6: A ball is rolling down an inclined plane. As it rolls down the plane, does its angular momentum about its center of mass increase, decrease, or stay the same? Answer: Assuming no frictional losses, the ball's angular momentum about its center of mass stays the same. While gravity exerts a torque on the ball that would change its angular momentum, the contact point between the ball and the ramp exerts an equal and opposite torque, preventing a change in angular momentum. Here is a six-question quiz about centripetal force and acceleration, and Hooke's law, drawing on information from chapter 3 of the source:
Question 1: A 0.1-kg ball on a string is swung in a circle with a radius of 0.5 m at a speed of 2 m/s. What is the tension in the string? Answer: The tension in the string provides the centripetal force. The centripetal force is equal to the mass times the centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is speed^2 / radius. Therefore, the tension is 0.1 kg * (2 m/s)^2 / 0.5 m = 0.8 N. Question 2: A child is riding on a merry-go-round with a radius of 2 m. The merry-go-round is spinning at a rate of 1 revolution per 4 seconds. What is the child's centripetal acceleration? Answer: One revolution per 4 seconds is an angular velocity of 2𝜋 radians / 4 s = 𝜋/2 rad/s. The centripetal acceleration is equal to the angular velocity squared times the radius: (𝜋/2 rad/s)^2 * 2 m = 4.93 m/s^2. Question 3: A spring has a spring constant of 10 N/m. How much force is required to stretch the spring by 0.2 m? Answer: Hooke's law states that the restoring force is equal to the spring constant times the distortion. Therefore, the force required is 10 N/m * 0.2 m = 2 N. Question 4: You hang a 2-kg weight from a spring scale. The spring stretches 0.1 m. What is the spring constant of the spring scale? Answer: The weight exerts a force of 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 N on the spring. According to Hooke's law, the spring constant is the force divided by the distortion: 19.6 N / 0.1 m = 196 N/m. Question 5: An astronaut on a spinning space station experiences an apparent weight equal to her weight on Earth. If the space station has a radius of 50 m, how long does it take to complete one rotation? Answer: For the astronaut to experience an apparent weight equal to her Earth weight, the centripetal acceleration must be equal to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. The centripetal acceleration is speed^2 / radius = 9.8 m/s^2. Solving for speed, we get speed = (9.8 m/s^2 50 m)^1/2 = 22.1 m/s. The time to complete one rotation is the circumference of the space station divided by the speed: 2𝜋 50 m / 22.1 m/s = 14.2 seconds. Question 6: A rubber band has an unstretched length of 0.1 m. When you hang a 0.5-kg weight on it, its length increases to 0.2 m. What is the spring constant of the rubber band? Answer: The weight applies a force of 0.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.9 N to the rubber band. The rubber band stretches by 0.1 m. Using Hooke's law, the spring constant is 4.9 N / 0.1 m = 49 N/m. ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/physics/quizzes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/physics/quizzes.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[significant-figures]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Significant Figures - The number of digits you can read from an instrument (including exactly one estimated digit). On a digital instrument, the last digit you can see is always estimated
On an analog instrument, it is up to you to estimate the final digit by interpreting the position of the marker on the graduated scale. interesting fact: The meniscus in liquid measurements is a result of surface tension competing with adhesion of the liquid to the container. If the liquid wants to stick to the container, the meniscus will look like a 'u'
If the liquid is repelled by the container, it will be humped upward like a droplet of water Accuracy vs. Precision Accuracy indicates how close a measurement is to the true value
Precision indicates how close measurements are to each other (or how consistent the measurements are). Significant figures ensure that the precision of our computed answers matches the precision of our measurements
They tell us how to combine different measurements with math, and come up with a reasonable answer.
On the subject of hobbits (or zeroes) Leading zeroes are never significant
Zeroes sandwiched between non-zero digits are always significant
Zeroes at the end are significant, but only if the number has a decimal point
Zeroes at the end are ambiguous if there is no decimal point Adding and subtracting numbers while respecting sigfigs The answer has the same number of digits after the decimal point as the least-precise input
The least-precise input is the one with fewer digits after the decimal point. Multiplying and Dividing The answer has the same number of sig figs as the least-precise input
The least-precise input is the one with fewer significant figures After you add, subtract, multiply, or divide, you use the extra digits beyond the sig figs to round the last sig fig.

Write the decimal number as a whole number fraction with a power of ten in the denominator
Simplify the fraction
Example: Write 0.25 as a fractionFirst, do you already know it? If so, you're done! It's worth memorizing a bunch of common ones!But, if you don't recognize it, the answer is simply to use long division and stop when you have enough digits to round to the correct place value.
Example: Write as a decimal to the hundredths place:Use long division to compute 3 divided by 7 out to the thousandths place (one place value more than what you're looking for! It's important for rounding!)
Result: Now round to the hundredths place: Sometimes, you can see a way to make the denominator into a power of ten easily. If you can do that, then you can just change the fraction's denominator to a power of ten and read off the decimal answer! Example: Convert to a decimal:
The whole-number part doesn't change, so we can just ignore it for now.

That means that you'll always either keep it the same, or increase the digit by one. That's true even if the number is negative!Here's how you do it: Keep all of the digits in places that your answer needs (so if you are rounding to thousandths, keep all the digits up and including the thousandths place)
Look at the first digit of what's left over. If it's equal or greater than 5, you need to increase the last digit in your rounded number by one. Don't "add" - you're literally just increasing the digit value! This matters for negative numbers, because if you "add a thousandth" you'll end up decreasing the digit value!
If the digit you increased was a 10, act like you're doing addition with a positive number and carry it appropriately. Think of negatives this way: is -1.9 closer to -2 or -1? Well, the difference from -2 is 0.1, and the difference from 1 is 0.9, so pretty clearly it's closer to -2. But, you might say, that made the number less than it started! This is true in one sense, in that it made it more negative. But, the digit value still either stays the same or increases by one. Whether that makes the number more negative or more positive depends on the sign of the number, but it doesn't change what we do when we're rounding.

proportional assignment of ratio parts
Converting ratios to fractions ratios with fractions and mixed numbers Working with ratios is tricky until your realize two things:
They're just fractions of a common denominator
You have to add all of them up in order to get the shared denominator.
Ratios are a kind of short hand for writing a bunch of related fractions all in a group. Example: You and three friends shared $240 in the ratio 1:2:4:5. How much money did each person get?What that means is that you divided the money into enough equal-sized pieces so that you could give that number of pieces to each person. , so in order to share the money like this, you need to split it into sized shares.Then, you just give each person the number of shares equal to their part of the ratio:. Since we have , so the proportional shares of the money work out to $20, $40, $80, $100.Ratios are indeed fractions, but we can also think of them as proportions and skip the denominator for some kinds of problems. Let's say we know that Gus gets twice as many dog treats as Maggie. We can write the ratio of dog treats as . Now we can answer questions like If Maggie got 17 treats, how many did Gus get? We know that he got two treats for every one of hers, so we can multiply her treat count by and get 34. This still works if the numbers aren't so nice: Say we have a recipe that requires a ratio of that's . We measured 7 oz of vinegar, how much oil do we need? Well, we know that for every four ounces of vinegar, we need three ounces of oil. We know that we have portions of "four ounces of vinegar" (divide the amount by four, that gives how many four-ounce portions we have). Now we know that for each of those, we need three ounces of oil. That phrase suggest that we need to multiply the number of vinegar portions by three to get the amount of oil: What did we do there? Since we know the amount for one of the ratio parts, we can see what we have to multiply the ratio number by to get the result. It's like a recipe - If you're making a double batch, you mutiply every measure by two. Well, if you have to make a batch, you multiply every measure by ! If you know one ingredient, find its multiple and then use it to figure out the rest.The oil and vinegar could also have been solved with fractions: Let the total amount of the mixture we make be We know that there are 7 total parts (), so the total mix is vinegar and oil. We know that there are 7 oz vinegar, so In order to find the oil, we want to know what will be
So we know there are oz all together. That means that there must be ounces of oil. Good thing we got the same answer!

The only difference between a multi-part ratio and a two-part ratio is that you're breaking the total up in to more categories. It still works exactly the same way: They are all shorthand for fractions of the total, and the exact fraction of the total can be found by adding up all of the ratio terms and using it as the denominator:if , then we can use for the denominator. We need to make some kind of variable so we can represent the total, so let's call it :Now we can see that they are all just proportionally-sized parts of whatever the total amount is. You can also see that you can compare them to each other:So that means you can instantly see how much bigger or smaller one part of the ratio is compared to another by just dividing the ratio terms!When you have a ratio, it tells you what the numerators are if you put all of the pieces over a single common denominator. We learned to add up all of the ratio terms to find a common denominator that makes the parts all add up to one, but in truth the ratio is true no matter what denominator you use!So, let's say you have the ratio a:b:c = 7:3:8 for some problem. If the question gives you a value for one of the terms, you can easily figure out the others by noticing that the ratio tells you how much bigger one is compared to the other. In the example, is , so c is times bigger than b, no matter what you're given for c or b. Let's say that you're told c is 24... Then to find b, all you do is divide by , or multiply by : .What about comparing one part to several other parts? It's as easy as adding the parts together and dividing:If , what is ? Since these can all be converted to fractions of a whole, we can use the same trick from above to do the math (the sum of all of the ratio parts is 22...):It works out so that you just add the ratio terms! No need for any fancy fractions.We have two basic approaches here: One of them lets of solve problems by comparing parts of the ratio to each other, and the other one lets us solve problems by comparing parts of the ratio to the total amount. So if your problem gives you the total, you'll usually be better off working with fractions of the whole (find the denominator and make a total variable).If your problem doesn't give you the total, but you have some information about the parts, then you can still use the fractions approach, but sometimes it's easier to use the one where you compare each piece to the others directly.

If you add some to part A, you'll have to add some to part B as well to keep the ratio equal, and you can use the proportion to calculate exactly how much you need.Remember that a ratio is written as a sequence of numbers separated by colons: for example. Each number is fundamentally just the numerator of a fraction, and the denominator for all of them is just the sum of the ratio parts. That makes the whole deal add up to 1, which is handy for figuring out how much of each thing you have if you know the total.Proportions tell you how to change the amounts so that you keep a matching ratio. It works by noticing that each pair of ratio terms has a "time-as-much-as" kind of relationship. In the ratio, has 9 times as much as . So if you know that , you can figure out that because , and .You can figure out the proportion between any two elements of the ratio by just dividing one by the other. Usually, you're going to want to know one of them when you already know the other, so which fraction do you use? Ratios work like unit conversions (in fact, they often are unit conversions!). You can think of it like this: I'm going to multiply the thing I have by a conversion factor in order to get the thing I want. That means I need to cancel out the unit from the thing I have, and add in the unit for the thing I want. Since you are multiplying, the way you cancel something out is by dividing by it. So, when you're doing proportion calculations, think in terms of multiplying by the conversion factor of .Example: A recipe calls for 3 cups of water and 5 cups of flour to make 15 servings. I need to make 25 servings, so what do I do? Start with the ratio: . Given that I'm making 25 servings, I want to know how much water and flour I need. The proportion of , so I need to multiply by : The same process works for the water, but in that case the proportion is .If it all worked out, we should have our flour and water in the correct proportion as well: , so . Now we check, is ? and , so it all works out! We can use these amounts, and the recipe will make 25 servings.
An architect is designing a new building. The building will be 30 feet tall, and each window will be 8 feet high. On the drawing, the building is 8 inches tall. How tall are the windows on the drawing? Start by noting that we have proporitional items here, because we are scaling something up or down. The true size of the building is 30 feet and the true size of each window is 8 feet, so they have a proportion of . We can also say that the windows are of the height of the building, or the building is of the height of the windows.
We know that the building is 8 inches tall on the drawing, so if we use our proportion of , then we can just multiply to get inches. The map has a scale that says 1/4 inch is 5 miles. If the route we're taking to New Orleans is 24 inches long on the map, how many miles will we be driving to get to the cruise terminal? The ratio of map-distance (inches) to real distance (miles) is . That means the proportion of real world miles per map inch is , so if we want to know the distance, we can use that proportion
, so we will be driving 480 miles. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=proportional%20relationship" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=proportional%20relationship" target="_self">Youtube search for "proportional relationship"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=equal%20ratios" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=equal%20ratios" target="_self">Youtube search for "equal ratios"</a> If we are in Mexico, and the exchange rate is $1 = 24 pesos, how many dollars do we need to bring if we want to have at least 2000 pesos?

Make conversion factors
Remember that you can multiply a ratio by any number you want that isn't zero, and it'll work. What if we want to "join up" a few ratios? We can do that by making the common terms match:, We notice that both ratios have a feet term (even though one of them only has one feet. Grammar is optional in math). We can scale the inches to feet ratio up so that it has three feet:Now, we can just directly make a three-way ratio!So how many inches per yard? 36, it says right in the ratio.You can also make conversion factors by noticing that the ratio represents an equation: means the same thing as So, we can make a fraction by dividing both sides by one side or the other: or That gave us two different conversion factors, and both of them are equal to 1! Remember that you can always multiply by one without changing the value of the expression, so if you have something in feet and you multiply it by the conversion factor, you'll end up with the same distance, expressed in inches (it's the same because you multiplied by one, even though the unit has now changed)! How do you know which conversion factor to use? Pick the one that has the unit you want in the right place. Sometimes you're trying to convert the numerator of a fraction, sometimes the denominator, sometimes both. The trick is to use the conversion factor that has the unit you're looking for in the correct spot. Here's an example: convert into :We have miles in the numerator position on the left, and feet on the right, so we want to convert that part from miles to feet:, so our factor with feet in the numerator would be .We have hours in the denominator on the left, and seconds on the right, so we want the factor that converts hours to seconds and has seconds in the denominator. This one is two steps long, because it's easier to remember hours to minutes and minutes to seconds:, and . If we scale the minutes:seconds, we get , so now we have the equation . Since we need to have seconds in our denominator in the result we need the conversion factor .Now we can string our conversion factors together: <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=using%20proportions%20to%20convert%20amounts" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=using%20proportions%20to%20convert%20amounts" target="_self">Youtube search for "using proportions to convert amounts"</a> If there are 7 frobs to 3 jits, and it takes 18 jits to make five wobs, how many wobs would you get from 84 frobs?

How many people in the modern world have ever actually done that?). The question then asks how quickly they can do it working together.The trick with that kind of problem is to realize that you have to add their rates to get a combined rate, then use that to solve the problem. They'll often give you the time it takes to do a job, or the amount of job they can finish in a given time. You can't add the time or the jobs done directly, but you can add rates. So the trick is always to get to where you have the rate for each thing, and add those. Example:Bob can bail three gallons of water per minute out of a canoe, and Jane can bail four gallons per minute out. How long will it take them to bail out their canoe if it's leaking water at 5 gallons per minute, and it started out with 10 gallons in it?First things first, we identify our unknown: = time it takes to get the canoe empty. That suggests that we should be using the amount of water in the canoe at a given time, and find the moment when that is zero.
What are our rates? , .
How much water is in the canoe after minutes? Working together, their rate is , so their contribution to the canoe's water looks like The total water in the canoe is then So, after five minutes, they will have the canoe emptied and be able to keep up.
That one was pretty easy, but what if the problem was changed:The canoe can hold 30 gallons of water before it sinks. If it takes Bob 10 minutes to bail 30 gallons of water, and it takes Jill 7.5 minutes, how long would it take them together to bail 10 gallons out if the canoe is leaking 5 gallons per minute while they work on it?
This time, we aren't given their rates, we're given their overal time and amounts. This problem is identical to the last one, except that we have to start by figuring out their rate of bailing!
Once we have that (it's the same as last time, just divide the amount they can bail by the time it takes), the problem works exactly the same way. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rates%20of%20change" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rates%20of%20change" target="_self">Youtube search for "rates of change"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=related%20rates" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=related%20rates" target="_self">Youtube search for "related rates"</a> Tom can paint Mr. Thatcher’s fence in 6 hours, while Huck can paint Mr. Thatcher’s fence in 5 hours.

Percents are (lterally) hundredths. Parts per hundred. We use them anywhere that will have fractional numbers that we need to be able to compare and remember easily, because they're "good enough" for most cases and they're easy to work with.
You can compute a percent with a quick two-digit long division
Percents are fractions with common denominators, so we can easily compare them (and add or subract them when they refer to the same overall quantity).
Converting percents to fractions just requires writing them over 100 and then simplifying
Multiplying percents is best done by either converting to fractions, or by converting back to plain decimal notation. Otherwise, remember you have to divide the result by !
To convert a number to a percentage, write it as a decimal, multiply by 100, and put a % sign after it! Yes, it works even if the number is bigger than one:
1/4 is 0.25, so we would write it as %
2.4 as a percentage is %
To convert a percent to a regular number, divide by 100. If you want a fraction, you can then write that number over 100 and simplify:
37% is 625% is 22.4% is Most of the trouble around percents comes from the language we use when we're talking about them. There are several question types we'll have to know how to interpret:
What is % of ? multiply What percent of is ? divide and multiply by 100 What is 10% of 30% of ? multiply How much does it cost with a 10% discount? A discount means a fraction of the original price is subtracted
Find 10% of the original price, then subtract it from the original price
OR (not and, OR) just multiply the original price by 100%-discount (90% in this case) How much does it cost with 14% tax added? Taxes and fees expressed as percents are fractions of the original price that get added to the total
Find 14% of the original price and add it to the original price
OR multiply the original price by How much does it cost with both a 10% discount and 14% tax? Does it matter which one we do first?? - we'll work it out in class!
Hint: each step works on the result of the previous step, so it is if you apply the discount first, or if you apply the tax first.
In real life, this can get complicated when there are special rules like "You apply the tax to the price before you take the discount, but the discount only applies to the pre-tax price..." If that happens in a problem, just work it through step by step and everything will be fine. What was your rate of return if your investment grew from to ? Subtract the starting amount from the ending amount to get the amount of change
Divide the change by the starting amount and multiply by 100 to get the percent change, which can be negative! Amount of change is percent of original: Our investment grew by 1.1%.

When you have a problem that is talking about percent increase or decrease, the thing you have to keep in mind is simple: You always start with the current amount and the increase or decrease is the percentage of the original amount, that gets added or subtracted from the original.With that equation, you can always find any of the three quantities (new amount, old amount, or percent change). Which one you solve for depends on how the question is asked!If the problem says it decreased by a percent, then the percent change is negative.Notice that we can factor the right hand side of the equation:That means that an increase will multiply by a number a bit bigger than one, and a decrease will multiply by one that's a bit smaller than one.
Decrease by 10% means the same thing as Increase x by 10% means the same thing as <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20work%20with%20increase%20and%20decrease%20percentages" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20work%20with%20increase%20and%20decrease%20percentages" target="_self">Youtube search for "How to work with increase and decrease percentages"</a> In 2009, Heart &amp; Sole Shoe Company sold 15 million pairs of shoes.

We're not going to take the square root of any negative numbers for now, because that would just be unimagineable...
Since the square root like this is defined to be the positive number, we have to explicitly state that we want both positive and negative when that's the case. We do that by writing it with the symbol (\pm in latex): for example
When we're calculating square roots without a calculator, it really pays to get good at estimating. Example: Simplify First, notice that this is close to 64000, which we can break into , and , so we can say Now divide by : , so our number is a bit big
We can zero in by picking the middle value and trying again: In this case, we got the answer! The key steps:
Estimate the approximate size of the answer by ignoring the small place-values and picking a square that's close to what you're looking for
Look at the digits: the ones' place will tell you what the possible answer digits are (if it's a perfect square - if not, you will know because there's no square with the right ones' place).
Divide by your guess, and use the difference to zero in on the answer. A good starting point is to pick the average of the two numbers for each step. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inverse%20operations" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inverse%20operations" target="_self">Youtube search for "Inverse operations"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=squares%20and%20square%20roots" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=squares%20and%20square%20roots" target="_self">Youtube search for "squares and square roots"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=$%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D$%20is%20the%20*positive*%20value%20by%20definition,%20even%20though%20there%20is%20a%20matching%20negative!" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=$%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D$%20is%20the%20*positive*%20value%20by%20definition,%20even%20though%20there%20is%20a%20matching%20negative!" target="_self">Youtube search for "<span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span> is the <em></em> value by definition, even though there is a matching negative!"</a>positive simplify simplify <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (math) (gr7) 9.1 From Squares to Square Roots (p. 351) <a data-href="2025-02-20" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-20</a>

Can I solve the problem by working with the squares of the terms (in other words, get rid fo the square roots entirely)?
Does it help to look at it as a fractional exponent? Remember the rules of square roots: Trying to determine which is larger when you're dealing with square root expressions can be tough, but you can often just square the terms and compare them that way. If , then (as long as ). Since we've defined the square root to be just the positive value, we can safely use this property to compare terms involving square roots.Example: Which is smaller, or ?Solution: Square both and compare: , so is the smaller term
You'll be asked to compute square roots to the nearest place value. The easiest way to do it is to figure out bounds, using your knowledge of numbers. You'll need to be creative in how you approach these kinds of problems because there isn't a formula to use.Example: Estimate to the nearest tenth.
Start by just noticing some facts. Going for the nearest tenth means we'll have two digits in our answer, so we can use our knowledge of two-digit squares to help. Here are a few: , , ...
Look at the list, between 13 and 15 we cross over into the 200s, so 14 is a good candidate. , which is very close to 200, and since and , we can say that the closest value is 1.4, and we're done.
The things that make that work are:
Knowing some squares (or being able to compute them quickly)
Knowing how the decimal places work when you're multiplying (two of the digits will be after the decimal for a two-digit product, in other words)
Learning to square two-digit numbers rapidly is really useful, so here's how you do it:We'll say we're computing for the example.
Find the nearest number with a zero in the ones-place digit. In this case, that's 50
What's the difference between that number and our real number? In this case, 3
Add and subtract that from our number to get two other numbers that are easy to multiply: in this case, 50 and 56
Multiply those numbers: Add the square of the difference we got at the start. The difference was 3, so we add 9: Why does this work?Let our number be , and let the "adjustment" to make easy numbers be . We're multiplying .
Notice that if we add to that, we'll end up with just So no matter what numbers we use, as long as we follow that pattern it'll work. We could even do this trick with 3-digit numbers or more, as long as it's actually worth doing (the more digits, the more likely it is that the adjustment number itself is going to be a hassle to square). <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Any%20square%20number%20has%20even%20powers%20for%20all%20prime%20factors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Any%20square%20number%20has%20even%20powers%20for%20all%20prime%20factors" target="_self">Youtube search for "Any square number has even powers for all prime factors"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Square%20root%20of%20any%20non-square%20number%20is%20irrational" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Square%20root%20of%20any%20non-square%20number%20is%20irrational" target="_self">Youtube search for "Square root of any non-square number is irrational"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Estimating%20square%20roots%20with%20upper%20and%20lower%20bounds" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Estimating%20square%20roots%20with%20upper%20and%20lower%20bounds" target="_self">Youtube search for "Estimating square roots with upper and lower bounds"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Comparing%20expressions%20with%20square%20roots" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Comparing%20expressions%20with%20square%20roots" target="_self">Youtube search for "Comparing expressions with square roots"</a> Prove that the square root of a non-square is irrational Which is larger, or ?

Square roots have a few rules of engagement that you need to understand. When you get them down, they'll let you solve problems more easily. Here's what you need to know:You can multiply square roots, by just multiplying what's in the square root:Naturally, you can use this in reverse, dividing out factors of expressions into their own square root terms. This is pretty handy for calculating square roots of long numbers:What is ?Unfortunately, we can't do the same things with sums and differences.

Here's a list:
A point is a speck, or a thing that has no properties other than a position
A line extends infinitely in both directions
A ray starts at a point called the origin and extends to infinity in only one direction
A segment is a straight path between two points
An angle is formed by two rays that share their origin
The rays of an angle are called its sides
The vertex of the angle is the origin of both of its rays
Angles are measured in two main ways: degrees and radians.
A degree is of the way around a circle, or of the way around a semicircle
A radian is the ratio of the arc length of a piece of a circle to the radius of that circle. There are radians in a semicircle, and radians in a full circle.
Angles measure relative direction of things. Here is a list of things you'll need to know:
Angles are adjacent if they share a side and vertex.
Adjacent angles can be added up just like numbers to get the total angle spanned by both.
Adjacent angles that add up to are called complementary angles
Adjacent angles that add up to are called supplementary angles
A line with a point somewhere on it is a angle, and is also called a straight angle
Adjacent angles that go all the way around and back to where they started add up to Using a protractor is easy, but there are some common mistakes. Here's what you have to do:
Put the center mark of the protractor on the vertex of the angle. Put the base line of the protractor on one side of the angle.
Read the number of degrees closest to the other side of the angle.
The common mistakes are:
thinking the center mark of the protractor is on the bottom edge. The center mark is usually NOT on the bottom edge of the protractor! If you put your vertex there, you'll get the wrong answer
Reading the wrong number for the angle. The protractor has angles that you can read in either direction. In order to do it right, read the angle from the arc of numbers that has a zero on the other side of your angle. When you started, you aligned the baseline of the protractor with one arm of the angle. You should read the angle from the number track that has a zero there.
Not aligning the baseline correctly. Make sure the baseline of the protractor is exactly above one side of the angle! <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=points,%20lines,%20angles" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=points,%20lines,%20angles" target="_self">Youtube search for "points, lines, angles"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=segment,%20ray" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=segment,%20ray" target="_self">Youtube search for "segment, ray"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how%20to%20use%20a%20protractor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how%20to%20use%20a%20protractor" target="_self">Youtube search for "how to use a protractor"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=supplementary%20angles" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=supplementary%20angles" target="_self">Youtube search for "supplementary angles"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=straight%20angle" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=straight%20angle" target="_self">Youtube search for "straight angle"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=complementary%20angles" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=complementary%20angles" target="_self">Youtube search for "complementary angles"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obtuse,%20acute,%20and%20right%20angles" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obtuse,%20acute,%20and%20right%20angles" target="_self">Youtube search for "obtuse, acute, and right angles"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=adjacent%20angles%20share%20a%20side%20and%20a%20vertex" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=adjacent%20angles%20share%20a%20side%20and%20a%20vertex" target="_self">Youtube search for "adjacent angles share a side and a vertex"</a> Prove that vertical angles are congruent Use a protractor to measure some marked angles What is the angle between the hands of a clock at exactly 4:00?

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that will never cross. When another line crosses parallel lines, you get a lot of equal angles. The easiest way to think about this is with the vertical angle theorem we proved last time - the angles on opposite sides of the crossing point of two crossing lines are equal. With parallel lines, all of the crossing points are the same! That means that angles in corresponding positions on any of the intersections are all equal. This is true no matter how many parallel lines you have.When you're dealing with problems involving angles and lines, adding extra parallel lines is often helpful in order to see the relationships more clearly, because it will immediately tell you what all of the angles are for corresponding intersections.

Interior angle: An angle measured between adjacent sides of a polygon on the inside of the polygon
Exterior angle: An angle measured between adjacent sides of a polygon on the outside of the polygon
convex polygon: A polygon whose interior angles are all less than 180. You can think of it as a polygon with no "dents" poking into its interior. If you stretched a rubber band around a convex polygon, it would touch all of the vertices.
concave polygon: A polygon with at least one interior angle greater than 180. These have a dent. A rubber band stretched around a concave polygon would skip over at least one vertex. the sum of interior angles of any triangle is always 180

The formula doesn't care which way is up, it only matters that you have the distance from one of the sides to the vertex opposite to it.
Pay attention to the fact that the area formulas are EQUATIONS! That means you can use the relationship to solve for any of the three missing parts - the area, the width, height, or base (if it's a triangle). You'll need this for several problems. The trick to finding complex areas is to break them into simple pieces. You can add and subtract areas, so just look for easy shapes and build up a set of them to add together. Sometimes a shape would be simple if you added more to it, like a rectangle with a corner cut off. In that case, just figure out the area of the rectangle and the area of the missing piece, and subtract. You can do this as many times as you need in order to find the total area. What is the area of each triangle as a fraction of the rectangle it's drawn in?<br>

Ranu says they’ll just keep the bottom of the triangle the same, and extend the top to the new corner, as shown below. Will this use the same amount of paint as the original?<br>

Trapezoid: Quadrilateral with one (or more) pair of parallel sides
Parallelogram: Quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides (parallel sides are also equal length, not adjacent obviously)
Rhombus: Parallelogram with all sides congruent (equal measure)
Square: Rhombus with all right angles
Rectangle: Parallelogram with all right angles
Kite: Quadrilateral with two pairs of equal-length sides, where the equal-length sides are adjacent.
Quadrilateral means "four-sided" and it encompasses all polygons with four sides. We're going to be looking at convex quadrilaterals for now, which means that all of the interior angles are less than 180 (there are no "indented" corners that poke inside the shape).We have different ways of grouping and classifying them:
How many sides are parallel? none: quadrilateral
two: trapezoid
four: rhombus How many angles are right angles? 0-3: quadrilateral
4: rectangle How many sides are equal in length? 4: rhombus
2 pairs (not equal to each other): kite or parallelogram. We don't talk much about kites... but they're quadrilaterals where there are two pairs of congruent sides, and the congruent sides are adjacent instead of opposite each other. Think of the classification as a bunch of checkboxes: Any given quadrilateral can be several of these at once. For example, think of a square:
quadrilateral? check
parallelogram? check
rhombus? check
rectangle? check
kite? check
Any trapezoid has an area equal to , where is the distance between the bases, and are the lengths of the bases.Since rectangles are trapezoids, the same formula works there. But, since the sides are perpendicular, is just the length of one of the sides. The bases are also equal, so it ends up simplifying down to (width * height) as you know from before!A parallelogram is a trapezoid with equal bases, so it simplifies down to , where is the perpendicular distance between two of the parallel sides, and is the length of one of those sides. For other quadrilaterals, the best strategy is usually to cut them into pieces that you can compute easily and then add up the results.
Is every square also a rhombus? Is every rhombus also a square?

For example: you might make a table of elevation data, where the row is the north-south coordinate, the column is the east-west coordinate, and the value in the cell is the average elevation for that area.
Columns and rows can also represent functions that are computed over the data, like a column for the average value of each row, or a row for the total value of each column

This is basically a shorthand for writing lists of numbers: you write the leading digit(s) to one side of a bar, then write the units digits of each off to the other side in a list
Works like a histogram, where the bins cover ten values each
The lists of digits to the right show which tens-digits are the most common

Use when you have a lot of samples of something and you want to see how they're distributed through all of the possible values
Create a bunch of "bins", which are ranges of value that you're going to treat as one group
Set the height of the bar for each bin based on the number of samples that fall in that range
The heights of the bars tell you how common it is to find a value in that range.

A line graph is useful to see how something is changing over time (or some other value that has a smooth range, like distance)
Each line represents a sequence of values for a single measured thing (like your height every year, for example)
Plot a dot for each sample so that the y-axis coordinate is the value, and the x-axis coordinate is the time, then connect the dots with a line.

Pie charts are good for showing how something is divided up into different categories or parts
Each sector in the chart is scaled so that its angle is proportional to the relative amount for that value compared to the total for all values
It gives you a visual representation to see quickly what's taking the biggest fraction, and how many there are.

For counting: Convert the list into the counting numbers, using the same operation for all elements. Whenever you're asked to count something that follows a pattern, the easiest way to make sure you get it right is to convert it into the counting numbers. In order to do that, you first need to write out some of the list of things. For example:
How many multiples of six are there between 15 and 97?
First, we need to see what kind of list we have, so we write the first few terms and the last one:The complete list would be . So, if we write the list without all of the invalid items (non-multiples of 6), we get:That list gives us the basic shape of what we're looking at. Now, we need to convert it into the counting numbers. We have two problems:
The list doesn't start with 1
The numbers aren't adjacent to each other.
Our strategy is this: Do the same things to every element in the list, so that we end up with the same number of things, but they've turned into the counting numbers.We need to solve both of those problems, but it will be easier one way than the other. So, what could we do?
Divide the whole list by 6 to shrink it down to the counting numbers, but starting at 3 It's easy to then shift the list down to start at one by just subtracting two from each thing Subtract 17, so that it starts with 1, but then we have 1, 7, 13, ... It's not really obvious what we'd do next if we started out this way, right? Those numbers don't have any common factors we could divide out...
Let's divide by 6:Now we have . We can just subtract two from each item:Now we have the counting numbers! So, there are 14 items, which means there are 14 multiples of 6 between 15 and 97!There are an unlimited number of weird countable things out there. Figuring out how to count them will always take some careful thought, some experimentation, and writing down some ideas. Sometimes, you'll want to count them in groups because you can use a trick for just part of the list at a time. Just remember this: As long as you don't change the number of things in your list, you can do anything on the way to transforming it to the counting numbers!Whatever you think of is valid as long as you keep track of all of the list items.
How many numbers are in the list ? We could also ask this problem as “How many numbers are there between 9 and 27 inclusive?” Given two integers and , with , find a formula for how many integers there are between and inclusive. (Remember, inclusive means that we include and in our count.) How many multiples of 4 are between 25 and 101? (a) How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101? (b) How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? (c) We know that , so shouldn’t your answers to (a) and (b) be the same? Why aren’t they? At Brown High School, there are 12 players on the basketball team. All of the players are taking at least one foreign language class. The school offers only Spanish and French as its foreign language classes. 8 of the players are taking Spanish and 5 of the players are taking both languages. How many players are taking French? <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (math) (gr7) 14.1 Counting with Addition and Subtraction (p. 510) <a data-href="2025-04-09" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-04-09</a>

We're continuing to count things today. This time, we're going to count the number of ways that we can configure a bunch of options. First, let's get some terms straight:
An option is one thing you could choose that's part of a group of interchangeable things (one shirt out of all of the shirts)
A setting is a group of interchangeable options that you have to decide on in order to answer the question. (settings would be which shirt, which pants, which socks, which shoes if all of those things have some options you can decide between)
I just made those terms up, they're not part of "the lexicon" so to speak. But, here's how they work:Whenever you're trying to figure out how many ways something could turn out, you can go through it a setting at a time and figure out how many options are left at that point for that setting. If all of them are independent, then you just multiply the number of options available at each setting together and that's your answer!Examples:
Make a one-topping pizza. You have three sauces, two cheeses, and seven toppings. Once you pick a sauce (three options), you can pick any cheese. So for each of those three sauces, you have two pizzas (
Once you pick a cheese, you can put any of seven toppings on the pizza. Since there are pizzas currently possible, each one of them could turn out in different ways, so you get possible one-topping pizzas Now make a two-topping pizza, where the toppings are different. We still have from the one-topping pizza question. Now we need to add another topping, but how many options are there for this setting?
Since they have to be different, there are only toppings left that we could choose.
So, for each of our possible pizzas, we could add one of new toppings, leading to possible pizzas How many ways can you assign three jobs to people in a 6-person patrol? Nobody can do more than one job. This time, we have to fill three spaces, so that means three settings.
The first setting has 6 options because there are 6 people without jobs.
The second has 5, because after we picked the first one there will be five people left. But, the 5 people left will be different for each option from the first selection, so there are ways to pick the first two
Finally, we have to pick the third person, but now there are only people left for options. So, we end up with ways to assign the tasks. The whole trick of counting in this way is to figure out what the settings are, and how many options each one has. If you can think of a way to give the settings names, it makes it easier to think about the problem. In the patrols/jobs problem, we called the settings "positions we need to fill," which made it easy to see that there are three of them and each one will have a different number of people for options.
How many ways can I get dressed if I have 3 shirts, 5 pairs of pants, and 2 pairs of shoes? In how many ways can I arrange four different books from left to right on a shelf? Your math club has 16 members. In how many ways can it select a president, a vice-president, and a treasurer if no member can hold more than one office? In how many ways can we form an international commission if we must choose one European country from among 6 European countries, one Asian country from among 4, one North American country from among 3, and one African country from among 7? <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (math) (gr7) 14.2 The Multiplication Principle (p. 519) <a data-href="2025-04-14" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-04-14</a>

Write the problem down fully
On the next line, rewrite the problem with all mixed numbers converted to pure fractions
Solve by the usual process of gathering like terms, simplifying, and applying rules. Each step gets its own line, intermediate calculations go off to the side Write the problem down gather all of the fractional parts (again with signs attached) and change bases so that they all have a common denominator
Add and subtract as needed
Simplify the fraction by eliminating common factors
Convert the fraction to a mixed number if it is improper
Add the whole-number part to the rest of the whole numbers and solve the whole-number part for the whole problem. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mixed%20numbers" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mixed%20numbers" target="_self">Youtube search for "mixed numbers"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=adding%20and%20subtracting%20mixed%20numbers" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=adding%20and%20subtracting%20mixed%20numbers" target="_self">Youtube search for "adding and subtracting mixed numbers"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=multiplying%20and%20dividing%20mixed%20numbers" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=multiplying%20and%20dividing%20mixed%20numbers" target="_self">Youtube search for "multiplying and dividing mixed numbers"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=distributive%20property" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=distributive%20property" target="_self">Youtube search for "distributive property"</a> Do several problems together ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/lessons/mixed-number-operations.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/lessons/mixed-number-operations.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[multi-variable-word-problems]]></title><description><![CDATA[scheduledJanuary 15, 2025 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="prealgebra-gr7" data-href="prealgebra-gr7" href="projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/prealgebra-gr7.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gr7's Prealgebra Course Outline START HERE&lt;&lt;&lt;</a>

Adding and subtracting equations Isolating a variable ("solving for it") Vera and Vikki are sisters. Vera is 4 years old and Vikki is 13 years old. What age will each sister be when Vikki is twice as old as Vera?What's the data?
Vera is 4
Vikki is 13
at some point, Vikki will be twice Vera's age
What's the unknown?
What age will they be when Vikki is double Vera's age?
How do you pick the unkown?
This one is tricky - it's not any of the named parts! Start by making an expression for each sister's age after some amount of time:
let a = Vikki's age
let b = Vera's age
Vera's age after years is Vikki's age after years is Notice we have another variable: , which is the number of years
We're looking for the time when , but and depend on n...
What about solving for ? So, Vikki will be twice Vera's age in 5 years, or when she is 18 and Vera is 9.For this problem, they never actually asked for the right unknown. We had to figure out what it was by exploring the problem.

It's not a case where you'll find a single number (usually). That means that many of the tricks we use from equations in order to get to a single solution don't really apply here (you can't "solve for y and substitute it into the other equation" because there isn't a clear way to combine them). What we do instead is find the lines that make the border of the area that's okay, and find the points that make the corners. There will be one line per equation
You can have more equations than variables with inequalities, and it's fine. You can also have less equations than variables - all we're doing is cutting off chunks of space that don't fit and leaving the rest!
If the inequality is or (strictly greater or less), draw the line as a dashed line to show that values on the line aren't included.
If the inequality is or (greater or equal, or less or equal), draw the line as solid because values on the line are included.
Each time you add a line, test a point on one side of it to see which side of the line is allowed.
Once you figure out which side of the line satisfies that inequality, shade it a bit. If there are already other regions shaded, just add more shading to the parts that overlap.
Once all of the lines have been added, you can mark all of the points where they intersect and darken the lines between (make sure to keep the dashed ones dashed!)
That is your answer - it'll be something between an infinite wedge shape and a multi-sided polygon.
Graph these inequalities and figure out what the valid region is:

Each equation is a line if you graph it, and they have to intersect in a point in order to have a unique solution
parallel and overlapping lines have zero and infinite solutions respectively You sold 90 donuts altogether
Jelly donuts are $7, and plain are $4
If you made $399, how many of each type did you sell?
What kind of donut brought in more money? let x = the number of jelly donuts sold
let y = the number of plain donuts sold Identify what the unknowns are that you're trying to resolve. What do you want to know? What will the answer have?
Identify all of the data from the problem and write it down
What relationships (equations) can I find that connect parts of the data? Write down equations that connect the data from the problem to your uknowns! You're not done with this step until you have used all of the data in a way that connects it to the unknowns, or until you have a clear path to the solution. Sometimes there's bogus extra data you don't need, so once you can see the solution you are done. Now connect the equations you discovered in order to find a solution. Remember that equations with two variables that aren't raised to powers are always going to give you lines, and there are three ways that multiple lines can interact: They can cross at one point, which is when you have a single solution
The can be parallel and overlapping, which is when you have infinite solutions
They can be parallel and separate, which is when there are no solutions. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=word%20problems" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=word%20problems" target="_self">Youtube search for "word problems"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=identifying%20important%20data%20from%20word%20problems" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=identifying%20important%20data%20from%20word%20problems" target="_self">Youtube search for "identifying important data from word problems"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=identifying%20relationships%20from%20word%20problems" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=identifying%20relationships%20from%20word%20problems" target="_self">Youtube search for "identifying relationships from word problems"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Creating%20expressions%20from%20word%20problems" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Creating%20expressions%20from%20word%20problems" target="_self">Youtube search for "Creating expressions from word problems"</a> Your yard is twice as wide as it is long.

By the end of class, we should have drafts for all of the paragraphs of your essay, and you should be ready to work on transitions and sequencing between them.Goals:
Turn your support-sentence notes into sentences. Remember that each note doesn't necessarily have to be exactly one sentence. Sometimes you'll wrap a couple notes together into a single sentence, and sometimes you'll realize one of your notes is going to take a bit more than one sentence to explain. This is fine!
Edit your topic sentences so that the match any changes that spring up from the support sentence construction
Make concluding sentences that reference the topic or naturally lead in to the next one. Ultimately they should do both. <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (lang) Write a draft paragraph for each of your outlined paragraphs.

Here's how it works: Every day, you spend some time reading, then reflecting and writing about what you read. The books you read are your own choice, but you have to have a variety of different kinds, and you can't get way out of balance (like reading the entire Cradle series before moving to another book...). When you reflect and write, your job is to create well-crafted sentences and clear ideas about the book. You can speculate about what's going to happen, talk about the author's use of plot devices, ruminate about how the book made you think about your own experience, or whatever you like. The only requirement is that you write coherently and that it expresses your thoughts about what you're reading. As you get further into it, you'll want to be able to connect ideas from one book to ideas from another. This format we're going to use will make that easier to do, so there is a method to this particular madness and it's worth doing.You can choose: paper notebook, or Obsidian. A paper notebook will be more convenient to carry around and use while you're lounging and reading, but Obsidian will be faster for entering text and searching for your past work. Not an easy call to make! In my case, I'll probably use a paper notebook and then try to write neatly enough that I can use OCR to transcribe it into Obsidian after the fact...In either case, here's what you'll need:
One page (or file) for a list of books you're interested in reading. In Obsidian, this could be a kanban for maximum awesome.
A few pages (or a file) reserved at the front for quotes and other graffiti that you collect along the way. This is for things that you just really liked when you read them, or things that made you stop and think for a moment.
A page laid out like a table, with the genre histogram on it (see below)
A section for each book you read, where you write more in-depth thoughts about it and cross-link things to each other as one book reminds you of other books.
The purpose of this list isn't to impose a schedule, but rather to remind you of things you've been interested in or that have been suggested to you. It's easy to notice something and then forget about it; in fact that's the default mode for humans. This list is here so that you have a chance to follow up on threads you wanted to pull. See somebody who looks interesting? Jot down a note to look for a biography. Something about history seem really intriguing? Look for a good book about it and put it on the list. Discover a new fantasy author you really like? Look up the first book in a series and put it on the list.This is where you take the best of the best from each thing you read, and jot it down. In my case, Miss Tick's quote about "following your star" would definitely be here:
If you trust in yourself. . .and believe in your dreams. . .and follow your star. . . you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy. Miss Tick, The Wee Free Men, p. xxx The genre histogram is here to make sure you don't neglect things that you might not otherwise go looking for. Here's the table I want you to use, with some books added for an example:The idea is that when you read a book, you put it in the column for its best-match genre, and you try to keep the height of the stacks pretty even. In particular, you have to keep your tallest stack within three of your shortest stack.If you're using obsidian, you can make the book names into page links that take you to your notes page for that book. This table can then serve you as a nice index for seeing what you've done. If you're using a paper notebook, put the page number for the book's section into the table along with the title.Each book you read will have a section dedicated to your writing about it. In this section, you spend some time to reflect after reading, and write down anything that you think is interesting that comes out of your reflection. The only requirements are that you must write with well-crafted prose, and express complete ideas (or completely express half-baked ideas, if you're still working out what you really think). The purpose of this writing is to help you think through your own reactions to the book and also to provide you with some good material for future long-form writing (essays and other things).You'll be building up a repository of powerful quotes, analysis, and broad experience of ideas that you can use to make really good work later on. If you're careful about indexing and cross-referencing this stuff, you'll end up with something that will be extremely useful to you for the rest of your life! So do a good job...

Structure - The sentences in the paragraph are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader.
Coherence - The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal the connection, including indications of change of direction or emphasis.
Unity: Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph.
Well-constructed sentences: The sentences are grammatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary (some simple, some compound or complex).
A single paragraph outline is... an outline for a single paragraph (gasp.)It's a simplification of the way we've been making outlines, and it should make it easier to organize your thoughts for longer pieces of writing. Here's the basic scheme:
Write a complete topic sentence. This is going to form the backbone of your paragraph and tell your reader what the main idea is, so it needs to be a good one.
Write notes for three or more supporting ideas. Each note must support the main idea - if it doesn't, save that for another paragraph (or update your main idea to be what you really want to say).
The notes are NOT complete sentences
Each note can end up making more than one sentence in the final paragraph! Example: a direct quotation or example can be more than one sentence Write a complete sentence for the concluding sentence of the paragraph. It needs to reference the main idea, but it should not be a restatement of it.
If you're trying to make a point, this is where that should be very clear. This will be an instructional paragaph, so we'll use a template that has a sequence of steps. When the paragraph is in a narrative or instructional style, it'll usually use time-sequencing style of transitions (first, then, next, finally).Topic: Control a robot's position

Topic sentence: Control a robot by keeping track of where it is versus where it needs to be, then generating controls to get closer.
Controlling a robot is simply controlling its speed and direction for a long enough time to get to where it needs to go.
When you're trying to control a robot's movement, it's important to know where it is compared to where you want it to be, and then find the best route to get there.
Proportional control combined with a good estimate of the error can make it simple to find the right control signals to navigate a robot to a target position.
First (note): Prop.Ctrl = big moves for big errors, small for small.
next (note): PC needs error, use to know what to do. Err = Target - Current
then: (note): incremental: each loop, only small change. faster for big errors
finally: (note): when small enough error, set controls to stop.<br>Use a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="subordinating-conjunctions" data-href="subordinating-conjunctions" href="projects/school-fall-2024/language/language-review/subordinating-conjunctions.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">subordinating conjunction</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="appositives" data-href="appositives" href="projects/school-fall-2024/language/lessons/appositives.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">appositive</a>, or a fresh <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="sentence-types" data-href="sentence-types" href="projects/school-fall-2024/language/language-review/sentence-types.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">sentence type</a> to set it apart and wrap up the paragraph. It might be appropriate to use a concluding transition to start this sentence, but don't assume you need it. Use one if it makes things flow better.Conclusion sentence: Controlling a robot with proportional inputs is simple, because the only things required are to know how big the gap is between the target and the current position, and then to make small changes in the right direction. seems more like a topic sentence
By following these steps, it's simple to apply proportional control to get a robot to go where it needs to be.
Proportional control combined with a good estimate of the error can make it simple to find the right control signals to navigate a robot to a target position. Proportional control is a simple way to use the size of the error to decide how fast the control inputs should move the robot. Big errors should give big adjustments, and small errors should move more cautiously. The trickiest part is knowing what the error is. That can be found by subtracing the current position from the target position. Doing it in that order means that you can use the positive or negative sign of the result to decide which direction to go, and the size of the result to know how fast. On an Arduino plaform, the control program only runs for a very short time, but it runs over and over in a loop. That means that the controls can be adjusted quickly, but that it's important not to take too long to make a decision. When the error is less than some amount that seems good enough, set the controls to stop the robot. By folowing these steps, it's simple to apply proportional control to get a robot to go where it needs to be.The next one will be a description of trade across Eurasia in the 1500s. In this case, we'll want to use varied transitions to introduce examples and other supporting details. Since this paragraph is not really telling a linear story or set of instructions, we'll be using more of the transitions related to clarifying, elaborating, and changing direction.Topic: Trade in 1500s Eurasia

comma splice
How to fix run-on sentences.
Run-on sentences are sentences in which independent clauses are joined without the right connectors. They end up sounding like a disjointed stream-of-consciousness, like what you'd hear if a toddler is telling a story. The most common kind of run-on is a comma splice, which is a sentence where two independent clauses are connected with just a comma.What are the right connectors, you ask? Well, let me tell you:
A period. (in other words, make more than one sentence!)
A semicolon (at last, the true use of this obscure glyph has been revealed)
A comma followed by a coordinating conjunction like and, or, but, etc.
A comma followed by a subordinating conjuction to make a dependent clause (so, therefore, then, etc).
When you run across a run-on in the wild, use one of those strategies to repair it.From the ACE book: 8 - real-world context elaboration.Fix these:

The five W's (and an H)
How to expand a basic sentence with more information
We're going to work on another elaboration skill called sentence expansion today. The purpose here is to take a simple sentence and add information to it so that it sounds better and also helps the reader understand your point more clearly. The process is simple: start with your sentence kernel (the simple version of the idea) and start answering some of the W's:
Who
What
Where
When
Why
wHow (shh, stop judging.)
For now, I'm going to give you a kernel related to something else we're learning, and I'm going to give you the question words I want the final sentence to answer. You'll craft an improved sentence that answers the questions.In the process of doing this, we're also going to use a special note-taking syntax to plan our ideas. I know that for a single sentence, this feels like an unnecessary step but we'll move on to more complex planning very soon and it'll be handy to have some simple examples to look back at.Here's the basic process:
Sentence kernel: The Mongol Empire ruled.
Question words: when, how, where
And your answer will look like this:
When: 13 century
Where: Asia and the Middle East
How: brutal conquest followed by peaceful reign
During the 13th century, the Mongol Empire was founded by Genghis Khan in a rapid, brutal conquest of Asia and the Middle east that was quickly followed by almost a century of peaceful rule and heavy trade along the silk road. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The%20five%20W's%20(and%20an%20H)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The%20five%20W's%20(and%20an%20H)" target="_self">Youtube search for "The five W's (and an H)"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20expand%20a%20basic%20sentence%20with%20more%20information" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How%20to%20expand%20a%20basic%20sentence%20with%20more%20information" target="_self">Youtube search for "How to expand a basic sentence with more information"</a> (Typescript) The sort method sorts. what, how, why (From Catcher in the Rye) He seems depressed.

FANBOYS (for,&nbsp;and,&nbsp;nor,&nbsp;but,&nbsp;or,&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;so)Phrases and clauses are both groups of words that work together in a sentence. The difference is that a clause has a subject and a verb—often, a clause could be a sentence if it were all by itself, and when it could be, we call it a main clause or an independent clause.Independent ClauseAn independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought. An independent clause is a sentence.

Dependent ClauseA dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought. A dependent clause cannot be a sentence. Often a dependent clause is marked by a&nbsp;dependent marker word.

Types of transition words
Varying sentence structure
Time and sequence transitions
conclusion transitions
illustration transitions
Change of direction transitions
Emphasis transitions
Transitions make your writing flow, and help your reader keep up with the changing topics as your idea develops. When you read a piece of text and it feels "choppy," or it seems like it was written by a child, it's usually because it's basically a list of unconnected thoughts. That puts a big strain on your working memory, because you can't attach things to each other in order to build up a working model of what's being said, and as a result you'll probably be frustrated by the writing.There are five basic types of transitions that we'll be working with:
Time and Sequence
Illustration
Change of Direction
Emphasis
Conclusion
They all have a place in your writing, and they do the important job of showing your reader how your different ideas work together. Mastering the use of transitions will make your writing stand out.Here are some examples of the kinds of words we're talking about:
When a transition is at the beginning of a sentence, it's followed by a comma. For example, "For example, ...".
Time/sequence transitions provide a sequence of events or steps in a process
Conclusion transitions express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, or solution
Illustration transitions give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement
Change of directions signal contrasting thoughts
Emphasis transitions prove a point or statement, or the reaffirm something previously stated. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Transitioning%20between%20ideas%20within%20a%20sentence." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Transitioning%20between%20ideas%20within%20a%20sentence." target="_self">Youtube search for "Transitioning between ideas within a sentence."</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Types%20of%20transition%20words" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Types%20of%20transition%20words" target="_self">Youtube search for "Types of transition words"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Varying%20sentence%20structure" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Varying%20sentence%20structure" target="_self">Youtube search for "Varying sentence structure"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Time%20and%20sequence%20transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Time%20and%20sequence%20transitions" target="_self">Youtube search for "Time and sequence transitions"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=conclusion%20transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=conclusion%20transitions" target="_self">Youtube search for "conclusion transitions"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=illustration%20transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=illustration%20transitions" target="_self">Youtube search for "illustration transitions"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Change%20of%20direction%20transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Change%20of%20direction%20transitions" target="_self">Youtube search for "Change of direction transitions"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Emphasis%20transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Emphasis%20transitions" target="_self">Youtube search for "Emphasis transitions"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (lang) Do the writing exercises in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/language/lessons/transitions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/language/lessons/transitions" target="_self">transitions lesson</a> <a data-href="2025-02-14" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-14</a>

The idea is that we will be reading every day and taking notes, on whatever books seem interesting.This page is for quotes you loved, and for small doodles that remind you of scenes you thought were really impactful, or events in the book you really want to remember.This is a list of books... that you want to read... for this project...Use the Genre Histogram (next section) to make sure you have a mix of things.We'll have a table here with rows for books and columns for genres. The goal of this project is to get a pretty even distribution of things we've read and written about.You'll have a lot of these, one for each book you read. This is where you write your thoughts after your day's reading. Practice formulating clear, complete thoughts and getting them into words that express your whole meaning. Use complete sentences with interesting variation in the sentence type and structure.This is your place to write things you like, dislike, or have any other kinds of feelings about with respect to the book. It's where you write down the thoughts the book inspires in you about other parts of life, or ideas that you get while reading. It's your space to see where the book takes you, but the purpose is to practice writing about what you think.Requirements:
All writing must be complete sentences with correct punctuation and grammar.
Thoughts that require more than a sentence should be organized into a coherent paragraph (or multiple paragraphs for really big ideas!).
Paragraphs need to have a strong topic sentence and a good conclusion.
Sentences within the paragraph must all relate to the topic.
Quotes from the book must have page numbers so you can find them again.
EVERY reading session needs to have a thoughtful entry in this file, there's no such thing as saying, "I didn't really have any thoughts about this part." ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/language/reading-journals.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/language/reading-journals.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[writing-revolution]]></title><description><![CDATA[Key themes:
Writing should be integrated into every subject
Sentences are the foundation of all writing
The most important stages of writing are planning and revising
Grammar should be taught in context of student writing, not separately.
Writing is a powerful learning tool for any subject when it's embedded well
Students need explicit instruction in writing, even if they are avid readers.
Instead of working on detailed syntactic knowledge of parts of speech, this approach focuses on the functions they have within a sentence. It simplifies the approach to thinking about appositives (noun modifiers), coordinating conjunctions, and other things that have very clear roles.
Fragment or Sentence? (p. 38 for details) Take sentences about current study topic and remove all capitalization and punctuation, then turn some of them into fragments.
Students identify which are fragments, and correct all sentences (including content, and patching up fragments) Unscramble scrambled sentences (p. 41 for details) Scramble the words and remove capitalization and punctuation in sentences either from lesson material or about it
Students rebuild correct sentences (both content and structure) Correcting run-ons (p. 42) Convert a string of sentences into a preposterous run-on and put it on the board every day. Students split it into independent sentences to correct the run-on
Try to ID the typical joining syntax they use and have them search for that (comma, "and", etc) to try to self-correct run-ons Make sure students can use and identify all four sentence types:
Declarative
Imperative
Interrogative
Exclamatory
Varying the sentence types among these four will help add interest to a piece of writing, and possibly generate some new ideas for how to convey the intended message. In this class of exercise, you give them a kernel sentence, which is a technically complete sentence that's stripped to the bare essence of what's required. You also give them a few question words (who, what, where, when, why, how). Their job is to turn the sentence kernel into a much more developed sentence that answers the question provided question words for the reader.The process has two phases:
Write notes that answer the question words. These shouldn't be complete sentences, and they should be written with a shorthand that uses arrows, lines, and other quick symbols to denote common connections between ideas
Write the actual sentence using the content from the notes.
Example: (in the context of Christopher Columbus) He crossed the Atlantic ocean. who, why, when
Example answer: In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic ocean in search of a westward route to Asia.
List question words on a wall chart in this order: who, what, when, where, why. and how. Provide kernel sentences that express complete thoughts but are not commands, questions, or fragments.
Level 1 students should start expanding sentences using the question words when, where, and why.
There should be only one pronoun in a kernel.
Students should write answers to question words in note form on dotted lines and write their expanded sentences on solid lines.
Students should begin their expanded sentences with when if it is one of the question words.
Students' expanded sentences should not add, delete, or substitute information (unless it's replacing a pronoun).
Use sentence expansion activities to help students anticipate what the reader needs to know.
Use sentence expansion activities to check students' comprehension of content.
Note-taking is a powerful strategy for gaining and retaining knowledge.
Below mid-third grade, note-taking should be limited to key words and phrases. After that point, begin to add symbols and abbreviations at your discretion.
Provide a sentence stem on a topic from class. They should complete it in three different ways using because, but, and so. The stem should look something like this:
Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road because ...
Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road, but ...

Make sure they understand to write a complete sentence that begins with the fragment, not make up their own sentence or write a fragment to stick on the end. They should write the entire thing.This section starts out with recognizing the four kinds of sentences (Declarative, Imperative, Interrogative, Exclamation). All of the exercises in here are way too basic, but there's still value in actually practicing varying sentence structure in real writing.Two things seem to stand out:
3. Challenge them to write a question that could be an essay question on a test about one of our subjects.
4. Write a paragraph using each sentence type (or some subset of sentence types) once. Forcing them to step out of declarative style in an essay might improve the flow and feel of their writing and free up some ideas at the same time.See chart of transitions on p. 89This is an area where some work will pay off. Types of Transitions
Time and sequence: provide sequence of events, steps in a process
Conclusion: express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution
Illustration: give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement
Change of direction: signal contrasting thoughts
Emphasis: prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated
Start with partial sentences, that either need a transition word, or that have the transition word but are missing the content that follows. After that, move on to sequences of sentences that need to be transitioned into each other.This would be easy to combine with sentence kernels and question words to practice scaffolding ideas into flowing paragraphs.Another name for a noun, or further explanation of a noun. There are several exercise types:
Identify appositives - given a sentence with an appositive, pick out the appositive
Matching appositives - exercise knowledge of whatever subject you choose by scrambling a list of nouns and appositives that match them, and have the students unscramble things (word match puzzle)
Add an appositive - given a sentence with a clearly marked space to fill, add an appositive appropriate to the noun.
Brainstorm appositives - given a noun, brainstorm possible appositives that could apply.
Appositive to sentence - given the appostive, create a sentence around it.
Topical - Given a topic, write a sentence with an appositive.
Given a list of short, declarative sentences, use conjunctions and transitions to turn them into a single sentence that expresses all of the ideas.A paragraph is a group of sentences that includes details supporting a specific point. Grade paragraphs on a scale that considers these four things:
Structure: The sentences are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader.
Coherence: The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal the connection, including indications of change of direction or emphasis.
Unity: Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph
Well-constructed sentences: The sentences are gramatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary.
A single-paragraph outline is an outline of one paragraph. The process to create it works like this:
Identify topic, audience, and purpose. If there will be many connected paragraphs, the audience will be the same, but the topic and purpose may change.
Create a topic sentence that clearly expresses the specific topic of this paragraph. Vagueness here is not okay.
Make a list of supporting details as notes, not full sentences. These will become the sentences of the body of the paragraph, but they may not be one-to-one in number.
Create a concluding sentence that references the main idea but does not restate it. If this is part of a larger piece, it's important for the conclusion to lead into the topic of the next paragraph. Distinguish a topic sentence from details: Given a list of at least three sentences from a paragraph, identify the topic sentence and the details that support it.
Identify the T.S. and then put the details in the correct order. Given three or more sentences, first identify which is the topic, then put the paragraph into a logical order with good flow.
Given a T.S., select relevant details from a list: The details should include related things that both support and fail to support the main idea. Pick out the good ones.
Eliminate irrelevant details from a list
Generate details from your own knowledge
Practice the three strategies for topic and concluding sentences: Sentence types
Subordinating conjunctions
Appositives Given a topic or prompt, generate a topic sentence.
Given details, generate a topic sentence.
Given a topic sentence and details, generate a conclusion sentence
Given a topic or prompt, generate a single-paragraph outline independently.
There are several standard "text structures" that are used for different kinds of paragraph. These can be used as the target for a SPO, picked based on the paragraph's purpose.
Narrative - telling a story about something, or a sequence of events
Descriptive
Problem/solution - describe an overall problem and how it is solved by explaining smaller problems and their solutions, and showing how they work together to solve the bigger issue
cause and effect - topic is the overall cause/effect, describe the contributing causes and effects inside
Pro and Con - analyze somethign in terms of desirability by showing its most important benefits and problems.
compare and contrast - Compare two things by describing ways in which they are similar and different
Opinion/persuasive - express an opinion and explain reasons why it should be accepted

Roth IRAs let you invest money that's already been taxed
They're ideal for starting young, because when you withdraw the money, its growth is not taxed!
You can only invest money that you earned by working in some way.
We have to open the account and manage it, but it is in your name, under your social security number, so you own it and will not have to do anything special to assume control when you're 18. We're going to open an account and put some money in it, but you'll have to learn how to track income you've earned in order to get the money in.
The IRS will be aware of what you do, and you may end up paying taxes on it because you're a dependent (sucks, but there's nothing we can do)
You're limited to $7000 per year of contributions
We're going to use a tool called hledger to deal with financial stuff. It's a plain-text format that's dead simple and will never become outdated by software upgrades and fancy tools. It's also something that's really easy to import into those fancy tools, so you won't be consigning yourself to a future of crappy software, and you'll also own your data, which is pretty rare in tooling these days.
Start simple: The temptation to go all-in on money tracking when you're full of excitement and ambition is really strong, but you should not try to track everything from the start.
Track just your income until you've solidly established the habit. This one's easy because you'll usually have pay stubs or other records provided for you, so when you've become lazy and skipped it a few times, you can go back and fix it. After you track your earned income, you can start keeping tabs on your investments as well. This is conveniently done for you by any good investment broker, so all you have to do is log in and copy a number from time to time. After you're committed to income tracking, you can start tracking fixed expenses - things like rent, insurance, utilities; They're very stable and follow a predictable timing, so it's much easier to keep up with them. You'll generally also be using your computer to pay the bills, so you can also use your computer to record them at the same time.
That's probably all you really need, unless you're doing some strict tracking to figure out a solution to a problem of some kind. If you want more detail than that, it's going to take a lot of discipline and scrupulous receipt tracking.
hledger is a plain-text accounting tool that makes it "pretty easy" to keep track of your finances. But, here's the deal: no tool is magical, and the only thing that actually makes this process hard is that it's hard to remember to do this. So, you're going to have to use every trick you know in order to establish the habit of tracking your money. Be prepared for this to be easy to forget.hledger does something called double-entry accounting. The whole idea of double-entry accounting is that it keeps track of how money moves rather than just how much there is. That means that every entry you make will have a place where the money came from, and a place where it went to. Sounds simple, right? It is not. There are a lot of things you'll do with money that don't have an obvious way to work with double-entry systems, but people have figured out how to make it work, and the result is a nice way to know that your "books balance," meaning that you didn't forget anything.Double entry accounting is very confusing at the start, because of the archaic terminology it uses. It's all based on an equation called the Accounting Equation, which looks like this: . The way to think of these terms is that assets are things you have that are worth something to you. liabilities and owner equity are things that are worth something to someone else. Since we're going to start small, let's talk about income first.Income is money that you get for some reason. It comes from outside of your sphere of control, and it goes into your assets (usually a bank account). When you want to add income, you still have to have something negative to balance the positive to your assets, so we make an account called income that represents the money that all of society has. You add income by taking some of that money, so your positive will be to assets, and the negative that balances it will be from income.]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/personal-finance/lessons/roth-ira.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/personal-finance/lessons/roth-ira.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[balloons-and-buoyancy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

How does it work? floating and buoyancy pressure, temperature, volume pv=nrt Ideal gas law Absolute zero
p = Pressure
v = Volume
n = "amount of material" - usually constant for the problems we're doing
R = Boltzmann constant or ideal gas constant, 8.314 t = temperature in kelvins (the absolute temperature) We know that temperature is just a statistical property of the energy of motion of the individual particles that make up a substance. In a gas, that motion also shows up as pressure.Temperature is just the way we measure the kinetic energy of the particles that are always rapidly vibrating in all matter. The faster they're moving, the hotter the temperature. But, how do we know that? The answer is that a lot of people did a lot of experiments in reality, but the thing that got us started was looking at the way gases behave as you change their temperatures. Here's the experiment:
Get a bunch of different gases and put them into a fixed size container with no leaks
Vary the temperature and measure the pressure for each gas at different temperatures
If you plot a line through the data for each gas, you'll get a bunch of lines that all cross at -273.15 C, because that is the point at which all motion stops and pressure would therefore be zero!
Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature for matter, because temperature measures molecular motion, and all motion stops at zero. We can record this temperature in any scale you like:
In Kelvins, absolute zero is just zero
In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15C
In Fahrenheit, absolute zero is at -459.67F
Imagine you have a 5 lb weight and you want to use it to make a hole in a board. If you set the weight on the board, it's not going to do the job. Now say you put the weight on the flat part of a thumb tack, do you think you'll have a different result? Why? In both cases, the weight is only putting 5 lbf on the board, so why should the thumb tack penetrate it easily while the weight stops? The answer is pressure - there is a lot more board in the way of the weight than there is in the way of the thumb tack, so the same amount of force is much more concentrated with the tack. Pressure is a way to measure how much force is pushing on a given area rather than in total.This shows up all the time when we're working with gases and liquids. We talk about the pressure in a pipe, the pressure in your veins, or the pressure of air in a tank. In every case, we're worried more about force per area than total force, because it's the force per area that makes things pop.

Archimedes' Principle Water pressure and depth Pascal's principle: a change in pressure of an enclosed incompressible fluid is conveyed undiminished to every part of the fluid and to the surfaces of its container. Pressure potential energy steady-state flow streamlines Bernoulli's equation Archimedes' principle: An object that displaces a fluid will experience a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.
Weight implies that this is in a gravitational field (or other directional acceleration)
buoyant force means a force that pushes the object upward against the acceleration of gravity
The force always exists, though it may not be enough to cause the object to actually float!
When an incompressible fluid is pressurized inside a vessel, that pressure is immediately transferred through the fluid and to all of the containing surfaces of the vessel. There is no directionality or variation to it. You could also say that an externally applied pressure is exerted everywhere throughout the liquid. Note that this is different from the pressure gradient caused by gravity!When you have a fluid with some depth, the stuff on the bottom has to hold the weight of everything above it. In fact, at every level, the fluid at that level is holding up the weight of all of the fluid above that level. Since fluids exert force through pressure, that means that the pressure in a fluid increases gradually with depth.The shape of the container makes absolutely no difference to this! Wide parts, narrow parts, tubes that follow winding paths, none of that matters, because of Pascal's principle. The pressure at a given level of depth is the same no matter what , as long as the fluid is connected.We talked about force as it relates to work and energy, and pressure has some similar traits:In this equation, you're doing work equal to the volume of fluid you've moved times the pressure you're working against. Likewise, a moving volume of fluid at a given pressure can do work.This is how hydroelectric dams work: They create a pressure gradient by making a deep pool of water, then they extract work from that pressure at the bottom of the pool by allowing it to jet out through a turbine. The pressure potential energy does work, and is converted in to electrical energy by the turbine.When fluid moves, it's called flow. When the flow is continuous and steady, and moves through a stationary environment, it's called steady-state flow. When you watch steady-state flow, you can't detect the passage of time - it looks exactly the same as if the fluid was still. Remember: a fluid is a uniform substance, so we aren't talking about bubbles and twigs in a stream, and if the flow is steady-state, there are no eddies or turbulent spots to reveal what's happening!If you were to somehow mark a particle of fluid and trace its path as it flows, you would be making a streamline (the path taken by a tiny portio nof fluid in the flow).In steady state flow, a drop's ordered energy remains constant as it travels along its streamline. Since all drops in a fluid are identical, the ordered energy per drop along a streamline is constant.Ordered energy can take three forms for a drop of fluid: Kinetic energy, pressure potential energy, and gravitational potential energy. The total ordered energy is thus:For the gravitational potential energy, notice that , so we can change the equation to be:Dividing both sides by volume gives Bernoulli's Equation:This value is constant along a streamline, and it assumes there are no friction-like effects that would remove energy from the system.

gravity, spring force are conservative friction, air resistance, others are non-conservative What are conservative vs non-conservative forces? A conservative force is one that does the same amount of work no matter what path was taken. It only depends on the displacement of the object in question. Example: Gravity. Your potential energy only depends on your height, it doesn't matter whether you take a wild ride to the bottom of fall in a straight line, if gravity is the only force, then you'll have the same kinetic energy at the end no matter how you get there. This is how roller coasters work, except that they have to deal with....Friction, which is a non-conservative force. The amount of work done by friction depends on how long the path was - the longer the path, the more time friction has to act on you, and the more work it does to slow you down. If it wasn't for friction, a roller coaster could keep going forever. However, friction is everywhere. That's why a coaster has to have the lifter tracks on the uphill sections to get you back up to the full height of the ride - without those, it would be stuck going over rapidly-shrinking hills because it's energy is being drained any time it's moving.Any time you have a system with conservative forces, the energy stays in the system and merely changes form. However, when you have any non-conservative forces in play, energy can enter or leave the system. Most of the time, it's leaving in the form of unrecoverable heat and noise vibrations caused by friction.When you're making LOL diagrams to represent energy movement at different intervals, the non-conservative forces are the only ones that breach the system boundary.

focal length for curved mirrors focal length for lenses Magnification object distance vs image distance Thin lens equation There are two kinds of magnification we'll be looking at:
Lateral magnification
Angular magnification
Lateral magnification is the ratio of the size of the image to the size of the object. Angular magnification is the ratio of the angle subtended by the image to that of the object.Magnification is a slightly misleading term - in common use, it means making something appear larger. In physics, it means simple making something appear with a different size - it could be smaller!Compute magnification like this:where is the distance of the image from the lens, and is the distance of the object itself. The sign of the result tells you whether the image is inverted or upright: negative results mean an inverted image
The magnitude of the result tells you the relative size of the image: Multiply the size of the object by the magnification to get the size of the image.
The image distance is defined to be a negative number for a virtual image, and postive for a real image.
This is the thin lens equation - it lets you compute the object distance (), the image distance () or the focal length of a lens if you know the other two:The focal length of a thin lens can be computed if you know the index of refraction (n) and the radius of each side of the lens ():All of the terms have sign conventions that tell you when the term should be positive or negative depending on the situation:The mirror equation for curved mirrors is identical to the thin lens equation!Mirrors can also make real or virtual images. In a concave mirror, a real image is made on the same side of the mirror as the object. In a convex mirror, a virtual image is made on the opposite side of the mirror from the object.

I can't put it down. A photon checks into a hotel. The bellhop asks if they can help with the luggage. The photon replies, "I don't have any, I'm traveling light"... Two atoms are walking along. One of them says: "Oh no! I think I lost an electron!&nbsp; Are you sure?&nbsp; Yes, I'm positive." Draw a circuit with a voltage divider. What is the formula for the momentum of a moving mass? Simplify What are models, and why are they used in science? What does sublimation mean? gr7: lightning3 gr10: lightning2 Science is all about observing reality in order to build models for how things work. Most of the time, "how things work" means "what are the causes and effects that drive changes in this system?" We design experiments that isolate variables as much as possible, then measure and analyze the changes in order to build a set of rules called a model. The model allows us to predict what will happen in other cases that we didn't directly study, so it is useful for practical tasks in the real world. Models are not perfect, however, and they are always subject to improvements as we learn more about how the world works!Designing experiments is a tricky art that's all about making very specific properties measurable. In real life, situations are almost always messy. There are dozens of different things happening at the same time, any or all of which might affect the results. In an experiment, we're trying to learn about specific relationships in isolation. How does one property of the system impact another?In order to do this, we have to design very unnatural settings in which we keep as many things constant as we can, only changing one thing so that we can see how the other thing changes as a result. The thing we're controlling is called the independent variable in the experiment - we are directly controlling it so it doesn't depend on other things in the experiment. The things we're observing are called dependent variables because they (hopefully) depend on the thing we're messing with.The easiest experiments have a very clearly defined independent variable, and a dependent variable that is easy to measure. We turn the knob and watch what changes, write it down, then think about it and try to come up with some kind of rule that can predict results in the future.In real life, it's pretty hard to get things like this completely isolated. For one thing, many of the processes we investigate naturally change over time due to entropy. In cases like that, we want to have a control that we can compare our results with. A control is another instance of our experiment that's as close to identical to the main one as we can make it, but it differs in that we don't mess with the independent variable. For example, if we're measuring the effects of temperature on the mood of frogs, we'd want to have one tank of frogs held at a constant temperature while the other tank has its temperature varied. We'd then compare the two, based on the assumption that the passage of time will have the same overall effects on both tanks (hunger, sleepiness, light levels, all the stuff we have a harder time controlling directly).Controls let you "ignore" messy dependencies between things when you can't hold them steady, so that you can get a better idea of what your intervention actually does.In order to design an experiment, you need to have a clear idea of what you're investigating. It's going to be a cause-effect relationship, in which the cause is a change in your independent variable, and the effect is the resulting change in the system. Design a setup that allows you to measure the effect accurately
Design a way to run multiple trials with different settings for your independent variable
Make a form or tool to record the data from each trial (including the control, if you have one)
After you have collected your data, analyze it to see if you can infer a relationship
That relationship becomes a model, which you can use to predict results for future trials.
Successfully predicting results for other configurations that weren't part of your original experiment acts as validation of your model. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dependent%20and%20independent%20variables" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dependent%20and%20independent%20variables" target="_self">Youtube search for "dependent and independent variables"</a> If you have a fan-powered cart and some weights, how could you design an experiment to investigate the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration?

What is a bias? What is the formula for kinetic energy of a moving mass? Explain what impulse is. Solve for the maximum angle that a book on a tilted board can remain at rest before the sliding force overcomes the friction force.
Use that concept to solve for the coefficient of friction
A Free-body diagram is a tool that we use to simplify the forces acting on something so that we can see what will happen to it. Here's how it works:
Draw a simple representation of the object (a small box, a dot, a circle, something like that)
For each external force acting on the object, draw a vector that shows the direction and approximate magnitude of the force. It doesn't need to be a precise diagram, it's just a representation so that you can have places to hang your math to keep it organized.
Use the diagram to figure out what the resultant force is, and from there you can answer a lot of questions. The Resultant force is a single force that will have the same effect as all of the forces from the diagram. Since forces are vector quantities, you can find the resultant force by adding up other forces. The resultant force can tell you in which direction the object will accelerate, and what the acceleration will be (as long as you know the inertia anyway).
You can also decompose the resultant force into other forces that are parallel and perpendicular to various things, which is helpful when you need to know something like how much tension is in a rope that's keeping a car from rolling down a hill. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.phyley.com/freebody-diagram" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.phyley.com/freebody-diagram" target="_self">Here's an article with examples</a>

There's a new theory of inertia, but it doesn’t seem to be gaining momentum. solving free body diagrams sine and cosine vector addition A book is at rest on a tabletop. Diagram the forces acting on the book. A gymnast holding onto a bar, is suspended motionless in mid-air. The bar is supported&nbsp;by two ropes that attach to the ceiling. Diagram the forces acting on the combination of gymnast and bar. A flying squirrel is gliding (no wing flaps) from a tree to the ground at constant velocity. Consider air resistance. Diagram the forces acting on the squirrel. A football is moving upwards towards its peak after having been booted by the punter. Neglect air resistance.&nbsp;Diagram the forces acting upon the football as it rises upward towards its peak. A car is coasting to the right and slowing down. Neglect air resistance.&nbsp;Diagram the forces acting upon the car. When you "solve" an FBD, you're really just adding up all of the vectors to see what the resultant force is. The resultant force is a force that has the exact same effect on the object as all of the other forces working together. Since forces are vector quantities, all you have to do to calculate it is add them up!

Universal gravitation and the gravitational constant Relativity, time, and mass Kepler's Laws All masses in the universe exert an attractive force on all other masses. The force is proportional to the masses involved, and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them.You can think of gravity as a field, or a bunch of lines that shoot out of the center of a mass in all directions. As the lines move through space, they spread farther and farther apart, so fewer of them will pass through an object that's far away than would pass through it if it was close. To understand the term, think of those lines as making dots on a balloon, and as you inflate the balloon, the dot moves outward from the center and gets farther from the other ones. The surface area of the balloon is proportional to , which is why the gravitation attraction depends on that term!The other thing in that formula is this mysterious constant - the gravitational constant. This is another one of those tuning parameters for our universe; it has to be within a very, very narrow bound or nothing in the universe can exist! The value of this constant is currently estimated to be .It turns out that Newton's laws aren't quite right when you get going really fast. In fact, they are hopelessly inaccurate when the speed gets high enough. Fortunately, in our normal lives we never encounter situations where that matters, so we can use them without hesitation. However, if you start working with orbits and space travel, relativity becomes very important.There is a speed limit in the universe: Nothing can ever exceed the speed of light. PERIOD. NOTHING.We'll do some more digging into this at a later time, but for now, let's finally pull back the curtain and see where the famous equation that everyone uses as a symbl of "being smart" actually came from.Albert Einstein did a serious of thought experiments, based on one simple idea: The speed of light is the same for all observers. If you're flying away from the sun at half the speed of light, the light from the sun will still be coming toward you at the speed of light... Think about what that might mean, and if you do a good enough job, you'll rediscover relativity.In physics, we always refer to the speed of light as c. Ultimately, he landed on a slight adjustment to Newton's laws, which we can write as equations for momentum and energy:First, momentum: It's the same as before, except that the denomimator has a term that involves our velocity and the speed of light. The closer we get to the speed of light, the smaller the value will become. Since that's in the denominator, that means that our momentum will grow rapidly toward infinity as we get very close to ! Now, energy:We have the same situation with the term in the denominator - the closer our velocity gets to , the more rapidly our energy grows. But, what happens when our velocity is zero? We get ! That's called the rest energy of the mass involved, and it means that mass and energy are interchangeable! They can be converted into each other, and when it happens the amount of energy is absolutely astonishing.The only way I'm aware of that this happens is during matter/antimatter annihilation, which we have only observed on the scale of a few atoms at a time.

An olympic shotputter throws the shot. On this one, discuss carefully where the motion begins and ends! Question: A car drives over a hill at a steady 60 mph. Is it accelerating as it crests the hill? Justify your answer with a motion diagram.
A Turning point is when the velocity of an object switches direction (like a ball thrown high stops and then falls back down). Analyze this motion together with a motion diagram.
What is happening to the velocity?
What is happening to the acceleration?
What is happening to the position?
Distance can be used to record how much movement happened, while displacement indicates how far the object ended up from its starting point. Are these different? Give an example of when they are different, and when they are the same.Graphing these can be very tricky. Start simple: Graph the position for an air-hockey puck sliding at constant speed, without friction, in the positive X direction. Graph the speed and acceleration on the same coordinate plane.Now, graph the position of a ball rolling down a ramp under the force of gravity. First draw a pictorial representation, then a motion diagram, and finally draw a graph of the ball's distance from the start over time. Add the speed of the ball to the same graph, and finally add the acceleration over time.Give them a graph of velocity with sharp-angled corners connecting linear regions. Ask for the graph of the acceleration that matches that velocity.<br>Use the full problem-solving worksheet to answer this question (<a data-href="pictorial-representation" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/pictorial-representation.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">pictorial-representation</a>, <a data-href="motion-diagram" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-diagram.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">motion-diagram</a>, and labeled variables and kinematic equations):Sally opens her parachute at a height of 2000 feet and descends at a steady 25 ft/sec.

Explain what impulse is. gr7 lightning points: lightning4 gr10 lightning: lightning1 These equations will get you a long way toward finding the solution for most problems with constant acceleration:
Notice that position is always a parabolic curve if you have constant acceleration (even if the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity). With constant acceleration, velocity changes linearly.BE CAREFUL: there are many situations in which acceleration is not constant. These equations will not work if the acceleration changes during the time covered by the equation. You can still use them, but only if you can break the time segments into pieces in which the acceleration is constant. Otherwise, you're going to need more math powertools (calculus).
If you need to know the maximum (or minimum) position, that means that the object reversed direction at that same moment (otherwise, it wouldn't be the max because it kept going even farther...). When it reverses direction, the sign of its velocity has to change, and that means that its velocity was zero in the direction of the acceleration at that moment. You can find that moment by solving the velocity equation for the time when it's zero, and then use the result to calculate what the position was at that time.
The acceleration at any moment is always equal to the slope of the velocity graph at that moment
The velocity at any moment is always equal to the slope of the position graph at that moment
Average velocity is often useful in problems with constant acceleration, because you can use it to calculate distance traveled without using the full kinematic equation <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solving%20kinematic%20equations%20for%20the%20different%20unknowns" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solving%20kinematic%20equations%20for%20the%20different%20unknowns" target="_self">Youtube search for "solving kinematic equations for the different unknowns"</a> find the dot product: find the vector magnitude of How far will a rock fall in 10 seconds if dropped in Earth's gravity?

Procedure
Choose a starting place on the floor about 20 cm from the wall for your car with plenty of space ahead. Mark the starting point with a piece of tape approximately 10 cm long. Use the middle of this piece of tape as the starting line for your car. Starting from the point you marked in Step 1, measure half of a meter (50 cm) and place another piece of tape parallel to the first. Repeat this three more times so you have pieces of tape at 50 cm, 100 cm, 150 cm, and 200 cm from the starting line. See Figure 2.1. Make all measurements from the middle of the pieces of tape. Wind up the car and hold it in place at the starting line. Keep track of how much you wound the car so you can wind it the same amount in all trials. Countdown “3, 2, 1, go!” On go, one partner should release the car.
The other partner should start the stopwatch when the front of the car crosses the first piece of tape. When the front of the car crosses the last piece of tape at 2.0 meters, stop the stopwatch. Record in Table 2.1 the amount of time it took for the car to travel 2.0 meters. Repeat Steps 3–5 two more times and record the measured times in Table 2.1. Using the measured distances and times, calculate the speed of the car for each trial and record the value in the last column of Table 2.1 average speed displacement vs distance instantaneous speed Computing speed from distance and time <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=average%20speed" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=average%20speed" target="_self">Youtube search for "average speed"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=displacement%20vs%20distance" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=displacement%20vs%20distance" target="_self">Youtube search for "displacement vs distance"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=instantaneous%20speed" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=instantaneous%20speed" target="_self">Youtube search for "instantaneous speed"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Computing%20speed%20from%20distance%20and%20time" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Computing%20speed%20from%20distance%20and%20time" target="_self">Youtube search for "Computing speed from distance and time"</a> A car goes from mile marker 27 to 30 in 2 minutes and 37 seconds.

Green laser
Red laser
Aluminum foil
sharp needle
sharp razor blade Make a needle-width hole in the foil and shine the lasers through. Record what you see.
Make a tiny pinhole in the foil and shine the lasers through it one at a time. Has anything changed? Is this what you would expect to see?
Make an extremely fine slice in the foil and do the same experiment. Make two extremely fine, parallel slices in the foil. How has the pattern changed? Light as a wave Light as a particle Light as a ray water-tub experiments diffraction interference wavelength and color (visible light spectrum) Light is a complex physical entity that's difficult to explain, because it seems to behave as a completely different kind of thing when you change the circumstances of the experiment. At the scale of things we interact with from day to day, you can think of light as a "ray" - it follows perfectly straight paths and casts sharp shadows just like a Hollywood laser gun. However, when you start making the features smaller, you suddenly get to a point where the behavior completely changes and it acts like ripples in a three-dimensional pond! It no longer follows straight paths, but wraps around things and spreads in every direction. Finally, if you turn the intensity WAAAAY down, the light comes out in single pieces! If it was just a wave, you'd expect the brightness of the patterns it makes to just get gradually dimmer as you reduce the intensity. What actually happens is that you start to see that what looked like a wave was actually a spray of particles, but each particle acts like a wave! The single "photons" interact with the slit experiments just as if they knew whether or not there is a second slit, even though each particle only goes through one slit or the other!To really start to understand this, we'd have to learn a lot about quantum mechanics, which is outside of the wheelhouse for this course. We'll be focusing on the ray and wave models, mostly because they are things we can actually do our own experiments with. Just know that at the bottom, it's weirder than you thought.
Diffraction: Waves that approach a slit or hole that's smaller than the wavelength will spread out in a circular arc as they pass through the gap.
Interference: When two or more waves interact with each other, there are places where the total energy is higher (constructive), and other places where they cancel each other out (destructive). This is called interference, and with light it shows up as "fringes" in a diffraction pattern. The places of constructive interference depend on the path length difference of the two waves: , where . In other words, where the difference in path length is equal to a multiple of the wavelength of the light, you'll get a bright spot where they are both at their maximum.
Destructive interference also depends on the path length, but with a half-wave added so that the peaks and troughs align: , where . When the path difference is equal to the a multiple of the wavelength plus an extra half wave, they cancel each other out. The spacing of the fringes depends on the spacing of the slits and the wavelength of the light: where , d is the slit separation, and L is the distance from the slits to the viewing screen. So larger wavelength and screen distance increases the fringe spacing, as does smaller distance between slits. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20wave" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20wave" target="_self">Youtube search for "Light as a wave"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20particle" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20particle" target="_self">Youtube search for "Light as a particle"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20ray" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Light%20as%20a%20ray" target="_self">Youtube search for "Light as a ray"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=water-tub%20experiments" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=water-tub%20experiments" target="_self">Youtube search for "water-tub experiments"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=diffraction" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=diffraction" target="_self">Youtube search for "diffraction"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=interference" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=interference" target="_self">Youtube search for "interference"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=wavelength%20and%20color%20(visible%20light%20spectrum)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=wavelength%20and%20color%20(visible%20light%20spectrum)" target="_self">Youtube search for "wavelength and color (visible light spectrum)"</a> If you have a green laser and a red laser, which one will have the most space between fringes in a double-slit experiment?

The bartender smiled wryly and replied, "For you, no charge."<br>We've used vectors to show the velocity of an object by drawing a <a data-href="motion-diagram" href="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-diagram.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">motion-diagram</a>. The velocity is just the change in position per unit time though, so what would the position look like if it was drawn as a vector? The answer is that it's just the vector that starts at the origin and goes to the object. If you have two position vectors like that, and you subtract one from the other, you'll get a velocity vector!So now we can see why the velocity vectors work the way they do in a motion diagram: They're just the result of subtracting an old position vector from the one that follows it.We also know that we can get acceleration vectors by subtracting the previous velocity from the current velocity.From our experience diagramming, we learned a few things:
Velocity is just the change in position over time
Acceleration is just the change in velocity over time.
Those statements look very similar, don't they? in fact, we can keep going with even more properties of motion (jerk is the next one, and it describes how the acceleration changes...)Those things can be turned into equations with a bit of thought. We're going to need a way to represent the idea of the change in something in these equations, so here comes some notation: , the Greek letter Delta, is generally used in physics to mean "the change in." So we'd write to mean "the change in x" over whatever time we're working on. If we measure position at two times ( and ), we could call them and . If we are going to compute the average velocity using those measurements, we'd do it like this: . Notice that we subtracted the old value from the new value! That's important, and I guarantee you'll get it backwards a few times because we're so used to doing things in ascending order. If you do it backwards, your velocity will be backwards! Watch out! We physicists are lazy creatures though, and we don't like to write more than necessary. So we're going to write as . Whenever you see that, it always means we're computing the change in something.Now we have a convenient way to write an equation for velocity: We can do something similar for acceleration, which is just the change in velocity: If you know the velocity and a starting position, you can figure out where the object will be after a time. Remember the rate equation: , which says that distance travelled is equal to the speed (rate) of motion multiplied by the amount time it was moving. That's our first kinematic equation, as long as we remember we're dealing with vectors here and we need to keep track of where we started. We'll use to represent our position vector, which means is our starting position: In other words, multiply our velocity by the amount of time passed, then add it to where we started, and we'll get our new position.Acceleration is to velocity what velocity is to position - if you apply acceleration for a while, you get a change in your velocity. So we can use the rate equation again, since what we have is the rate of change of velocity. We'll use for our current velocity, and for our starting velocity (before the acceleration that we're dealing with happened:In other words, multiply the acceleration by the amount of time it was applied, then add that velocity change to the velocity we started with, and you'll get our new velocity.Here's the hard one. If you have just the acceleration, you can use it to see how far you've travelled. The trick here is to realize that we're adding up all of the little changes to velocity that happened over some period of time (), but then we still have to multiply it by the time because our position change is a velocity times time! When we get to calculus this will be easier to understand, but for now remember that you multiply acceleration by time to get velocity, and then you mutiply velocity by time to get position, so you can squint your eyes and see how you'd use time squared to go straight from acceleration to position. Our first crack at this would look like this then: . Wait, you say, why the half? Remember that we were calculating the average velocity above, and over this time interval, we'd add up the starting and final velocities then divide by two to get the average. That's not the real reason, but it's related so keep that intuitive idea.Now, that equation is fine as long as we aren't already moving when the whole business gets started. But what if we are already coasting along before the acceleration hits? Can we still figure out where we'll end up? Yes! The thing to remember is that these vector quantities can all be added together, so if we had some velocity before we started, we can just multiply it by the same and add it to the equation:And there you have it, the path from acceleration to position.

After all, it's velocity vector is changing, so there must be acceleration happening. This is where we finally break the idea that accelerating = going faster once and for all! You can go in a circle without changing speed, forever. If the planets were it perfectly circular orbits, this is exactly what they would do (for some values of "forever" including "a really, really long time").So how can that be? How can you accelerate forever without any energy going in to the system? How is it that your velocity can be constantly changing but your speed is constant? The answer to both is from one idea: In circular motion, the acceleration always points toward the center of the rotationWe know from geometry that that a line from the center of a circle is always perpendicular to the circle where it crosses. We also know that work only happens when some component of the motion is parallel to the force. Taking those together, we can see that the centripetal force doesn't do any work! It's always perpendicular to the object, so it doesn't change its kinetic energy.Centripetal acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius of the arc, and directly proportional to the squared speed of the motion. The larger the arc, the lower the acceleration. The higher the speed, the higher the acceleration. . We usually write this using angular velocity though:, so So, we can write , or centripetal acceleration is the angular velocity squared time the radius of the turn.We also know that , so the centripetal force must be From that, we can figure out a whole bunch of neat stuff.

gr10: lightning1Light rays are not real, they're just a useful model! A light ray is an imaginary thing that represents how light seems to work in everyday life:
It travels in straight lines when it's in a single medium
It continues forever unless stopped
It reflects at predictable angles.
When you use the ray model of light to figure out what optical systems will do, the objects in the system are the sources for the rays. You'll pick a point on the object and trace various rays through the system to see what happens.
When the rays from one point all converge on another point, an image will form. This is a real image, meaning that if you put a screen there, you'd see a picture of the scene projected onto it.
When the rays of light seem to come from a point that isn't really there, you get a virtual image. Putting a screen there would show nothing special, but if you look through the system, it will seem like the scene is reproduced out where the rays converge.
Images are created by reflections and refractions of light rays.
Your eye sees an image when diverging rays from an object are focused onto a real image on your retina by the lens in your eye.
By tracing the rays through the system and finding the real and virtual images, you can figure out things like magnification, inversion, and other stuff that happens in the system. This is how you design things like telescopes and microscopes.A pinhole camera is just about the simplest interesting optical device. The idea is simple: you make a hole so small that it restricts all of the light rays coming through to basically a single point. That means that, no matter what angle or distance, the light rays that pass through at a given angle all came from the same place. That means that light passing through a pinhole will always make a real image on a screen behind it.This is what we did with the small mirror during the eclipse, and it's why all of the light spots through the leaves in the bamboo patch during the eclipse were mini-pictures of the eclipse: they were all pinhole cameras!

You want to take a photo of your friend, who is 2 m tall. How far should they be from the aperture of the camera in order to make a 5 cm image?
In treasure hunter movies, sometimes the heros enter a dark chamber where the treasure is, and they angle a mirror that suddenly hits a dozen other mirrors and lights the entire space up like it's daylight. Why is this ridiculous?
Why is it silly to think that you'd see a laser beam shining in space if you aren't in its direct path (like the laser guns in Star Wars, for example)?

Refraction: When light passes through the boundary between different materials, it bends Light can also reflect or absorb when it hits a boundary between materials. Often, all three happen. Bending of light is what allows us to see and make optical instruments.
Snell's law: is the refractive index of the material, one for each side of the boundary is the angle that the light "ray" forms with the surface normal of the boundary. The normal is a vector that is perpendicular to the surface (just like in 3D modeling) <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law" target="_self">Wikipedia: Snell's Law</a><br>

It happens because different materials change the speed of light that passe through them. Considering light as a wave, if you change its speed in a way that intercepts the wave at an angle to its direction of propagation, it ends up bending the wave. The diagram below was created by Christiaan Huygens in 1678, and it does a great job of illustrating what's happening:<br><img alt="_resources/refraction/64d15783cc7dbf7909d8903cc10000ac_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/_resources/refraction/64d15783cc7dbf7909d8903cc10000ac_md5.jpeg" target="_self">Lenses work by making this bending happen over a curved surface, so that the wave is bent in a way that sends all of the motion toward (or away from) a specific focal point.Snell's Law describes how this bending works: Light bends more when its angle is farther away from the normal to the surface. The relationship looks like this:Where the terms represent the index of refraction of the material. This number changes from material to material, and represents the amount of bend that the light will be subjected to as it passes through the boundary. But wait, you say, if all of the light bends by the same amount, why do prisms make rainbows?It turns out that the index of refraction is not the same for all colors of light, so when you get a number like , it represents a sort-of average value. It will be slightly higher for shorter wavelengths, and lower for long wavelengths. That means that colors toward the violet end of the spectrum will be bent more than colors toward the red end, and you end up with the colors of the rainbow (ROYGBIV).When light enters a material with a lower speed of light (a higher optical density and a greater index of refraction), it bends toward the normal going into the material. When it enters a material with a higher speed of light (lower optical density, lower index of refraction), it bends away from the normal pointing into that material.<br>One easy way to remember this is to use two rays of light that are close to each other. Pretend they are connected by a string or a ruler, going along parallel to each other. If the light hits the surface at an angle, one of the two will be first to hit. If it slows down, then the light bends toward the new material. If it speeds up, then the light has to bend the other way in order for them to stay connected. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPCUkwgMXuk" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPCUkwgMXuk" target="_self">REMEMBER THE LAWN MOWER!!!!</a>
What happens when light passes through the boundary between two different materials. The refractive index of a particular kind of glass is 1.5. If light hits it at an angle of 70, what angle will the light be at while inside the glass?

After all, it's velocity vector is changing, so there must be acceleration happening. This is where we finally break the idea that accelerating = going faster once and for all! You can go in a circle without changing speed, forever. If the planets were it perfectly circular orbits, this is exactly what they would do (for some values of "forever" including "a really, really long time").So how can that be? How can you accelerate forever without any energy going in to the system? How is it that your velocity can be constantly changing but your speed is constant? The answer to both is from one idea: In circular motion, the acceleration always points toward the center of the rotationWe know from geometry that that a line from the center of a circle is always perpendicular to the circle where it crosses. We also know that work only happens when some component of the motion is parallel to the force. Taking those together, we can see that the centripetal force doesn't do any work! It's always perpendicular to the object, so it doesn't change its kinetic energy.Centripetal acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius of the arc, and directly proportional to the squared speed of the motion. The larger the arc, the lower the acceleration. The higher the speed, the higher the acceleration. . We usually write this using angular velocity though:, so So, we can write , or centripetal acceleration is the angular velocity squared time the radius of the turn.We also know that , so the centripetal force must be From that, we can figure out a whole bunch of neat stuff.

plumbing and water pressure pressure vs depth in a fluid streamlines Bernoulli's principle pumps All liquids are incompressible Liquids under pressure obey energy laws just like other matter. We can compute the kinetic energy, work, momentum, and other properties of liquid in the same way (using mass and velocity, etc), or we can take advantage of the way liquid's mass and volume are interchangeable to get a different, more useful formula.In a liquid, the pressure that the liquid is under is a new form of potential energy that we haven't worked with yet. Pressure is what causes liquids to move through pipes and other spaces, so it clearly can do work on the fluid. The amount of work it can do could be calculated by the force and mass, but if you work through it, you find that all you need is the pressure and volume (the mass and force term are wrapped up in those because the pressure is over area and the mass depends on the volume).In a liquid, the amount of work done in moving it is equal to . Using the idea of work and energy being convertible back and forth, we can define the idea of pressure potential energy as being the same as the work done in moving liquid. However, this concept is only valid for steadily moving liquid! You can't pump up a container of liquid to a high pressure and expect to get work from it, because liquids are incompressible and cannot store energy as pressure (with a gas, this scheme would actually work).A fluid moving in steady state flow has three kinds of ordered energy: kinetic, pressure potential, and gravitational potential. Bernoulli's principle tells us that these three things add up to a constant for every streamline in steady-state flow:Using that, we can figure out how fast the liquid is moving through any part of a system, and how much pressure it's under. Since the water in a streamline has to have constant ordered energy, increasing the velocity drops the pressure! Pumping water through a system of pipes of various diameters has some interesting consequences:
The same volume of water has to flow through every part of the system in a given time.
That means the velocity of the water depends on the diameter of the pipe: Skinny pipes mean fast,low-pressure water.
So you have pressurized water in a pipe, and you spray it out of a good nozzle that converts its pressure potential energy into the maximum amount of kinetic energy. How high will it go?Assuming that our pump is at the same height as our nozzle, so we're not losing or gaining anything from gravity, then the full pressure potential turns into kinetic energy. We know that the kinetic energy is equal to , so we need to know the density of our liquid. Once we have that, we can solve for the velocity (remember that the pressure potential energy is known because we know all about our pump):But, how big should the nozzle be? Well, we know what our target velocity is, and we know what pressure we need. Now we need to know how much water the pump can supply at that pressure, in other words, how much work can the pump do over a given time? (remember: ). Pumps usually have a power rating: work per time, or As long as we make sure our nozzle is small enough that the amount of liquid passing through it per second at the max speed is less than the max power of the pump, we'll get full height from our spray.Let's say you have a big lake of water way up high, and a pipe running down to some place where you want a fountain. How big can your nozzle be to get full spray height, like with the pump? Well, gravity-fed pressure is special: you don't need a nozzle! The acceleration due to gravity can move any amount of water at full pressure, so all you need to do is point the pipe upward and you've got the max height possible!

The name comes from the shape of the diagram: There are two bar-charts with a circular area in the middle, so it looks like the letters "LOL," lol.At any given time, a system will have energy within it in various forms:
Kinetic - energy of motion
Potential - energy of motion that could happen because of a force
Thermal - energy of heat
Chemical - energy of incomplete chemical reactions
Electrical - energy of charge movement
An energy bar chart is just a bar chart that shows the energy content of a system for each kind of energy you're interested in. The simplest one for our purposes just shows kinetic and potential energy:<br><img alt="energy-bar-chart.svg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/_resources/energy-bar-chart.svg" target="_self">A LOL chart is a graphical way to describe how the energy of a system changes during some scenario. It has two bar charts along with a system diagram between them. The bar chart on the left shows the system's energy before the scenario, and the one of the right shows it afterward. The system diagram shows whether energy enters or leaves the system during the scenario.This chart shows the energy change in the scenario, "A ball flies upward until it reaches the top of its trajectory." The system is the ball-earth system. Since the ball and earth are directly working on each other, there is no external force, and the system doesn't have an energy change (there's no arrow in the center circle).<br><img alt="lol-basic.svg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/_resources/lol-basic.svg" target="_self">In the next chart, the scenario is, "A chemical rocket launches into the sky." The system is just the rocket and fuel. In this case, only part of the chemical energy of the fuel is turned into kinetic and potential energy for the rocket. The rest is lost as heat, so energy leaves the system. = Chemical energy, stored in the fuel = Kinetic energy, increased when the rocket gains speed = Potential energy, increased when the rocket gains altitude
Thermal energy is lost when the fuel is burned, because not all of it could be turned into thrust.
<br><img alt="lol-rocket-launch.svg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/_resources/lol-rocket-launch.svg" target="_self">Remember: the unit of work is , just the same as energy! If you do work on a thing, you are changing its energy (and yours, in the form of chemical energy from food and accumulated body heat from exertion). There are many ways this can happen:
You rapidly knead bread, applying force on it over short distances repeatedly as you press the dough. The dough heats up (increasing thermal energy, by spending your own chemical energy)
You lift a book from the floor to a shelf (increasing gravitational potential energy by spending chemical energy)
You carefully lower a heavy object to the floor (decreasing gravitational potential energy... negative work!, sill by spending your chemical energy).
You pedal your bike furiously to accelerate at the start of a race (increasing kinetic energy by spending your chemical energy)
The amount of work done is determined by the equation . Note that a force is measured in Newtons, which are . Multiplying that by a distance yields the energy unit of the joule, or .There are many, many uses for energy in physics computations. It can simplify all sorts of things that would otherwise be hard to analyze:
Burning fuel to accelerate
Speed while rolling down an unevenly-shaped hill
How high a projectile will go
How fast a falling object is moving
In fact, it's so useful that I recommend asking yourself if you can solve a problem using energy before you even consider other methods. It can often make solutions simpler for kinematics problems especially.

Require proper vector notation in all cases - it's important to solidify the difference between vectors and scalars, especially for things like dot product that involve both.
Review the main trigonometric ratios (sin,cos,tan) and practice relating them to vector components
Find the angle of a vector
Find the parallel and perpendicular decomp of a vector with respect to a tilted line (specify the angle of the line sometimes, and the slope other times).
Intuitive understanding of motion is almost always both wrong and deeply entrenched. It takes extra time to untangle beliefs and get the mind thinking in terms of position, acceleration, and velocity.
Start with a picture of a ramp that shows a ball in various positions (separated equally in time not space) as it accelerates down the ramp
Ask them to identify the average velocity of the ball over each gap
Ask them to identify the acceleration of the ball
Most students confuse velocity and acceleration "positive" acceleration doesn't mean "speeding up", it means the acceleration vector is pointing in the positive direction

Let them practice relating graphs of motion properties graph position, velocity, and acceleration
Figure out what the missing graph should look like based on the provided one(s)
Connect concepts with motion diagrams to help understand how graping one thing is graphing the rate of change at any given time for another
Focus on understanding how it looks when we put time on the horizontal axis and position on the vertical (especially when the actual position is changing in the horizontal direction!)

Position: Where an object is located, relative to a reference point. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (distance) and direction [1].
Velocity: The rate at which an object's position changes with time. Its magnitude is speed [1].
Acceleration: The rate at which an object's velocity changes with time. It can involve changes in speed, direction, or both [2].
Mass: A measure of an object's inertia, or resistance to changes in velocity [2].
Force: A push or pull that can cause an object to accelerate. It is a vector quantity [2].
Newton's Laws of Motion (Translational)
First Law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force [3].
Second Law: An object's acceleration is equal to the net force acting on it divided by its mass (F = ma) [4, 5].
Third Law: For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force [6, 7]. Angular Position: An object's orientation relative to a reference orientation [8].
Angular Velocity: The rate at which an object's angular position changes with time [9].
Angular Acceleration: The rate at which an object's angular velocity changes with time [10].
Rotational Mass (Moment of Inertia): A measure of an object's resistance to changes in angular velocity [11].
Torque: A twist or spin that can cause an object to undergo angular acceleration [12].
Newton's Laws of Motion (Rotational)
First Law: A rigid, non-wobbling object not subject to any outside torques rotates at a constant angular velocity [12].
Second Law: The net torque acting on a rigid, non-wobbling object is equal to its rotational mass times its angular acceleration (τ = I α) [13].
Third Law: For every torque, there is an equal and opposite reaction torque [14]. Linear Momentum: A measure of an object's translational motion and its resistance to changes in that motion. It is equal to the object's mass times its velocity (p = m v) [15].
Angular Momentum: A measure of an object's rotational motion and its resistance to changes in that motion. It is equal to the object's rotational mass times its angular velocity (L = I ω) [16]. Impulse: The change in an object's momentum due to a force applied over time (Δp = F t) [17].
Angular Impulse: The change in an object's angular momentum due to a torque applied over time (ΔL = τ t) [18]. Work: The transfer of energy to an object by applying a force over a distance or a torque over an angle [19, 20].
Energy: The capacity to do work. It can take various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, and others [21]. Force and Acceleration: Force is the cause of acceleration, and acceleration requires a force [22].
Torque and Angular Acceleration: Torque is the cause of angular acceleration, and angular acceleration requires a torque [23].
Momentum and Impulse: Changes in momentum are caused by impulses [24].
Angular Momentum and Angular Impulse: Changes in angular momentum are caused by angular impulses [18].
Work and Energy Transfer: Work is a mechanism for transferring energy [21].
Conservation Laws: Energy, momentum, and angular momentum are conserved quantities [15, 21, 25].
Applying a force to a skating object over time changes its momentum, which is a measure of its tendency to keep moving [26].Exerting a torque on a seesaw over time changes its angular momentum, affecting its rotational motion [18].Imagine a mass at the end of a long, massless pole. You are trying to push the mass forward by applying a torque to the opposite end of the pole. in an infinitesimal slice of time, the mass will move a tiny distance forward in a straight path. Therefore, the work done on the mass in that instant is equal to the force applied to it by its end of the lever, times the distance it moved. The force applied at the mass end is scaled down by the length of the lever arm though, due to mechanical advantage.However, its distance of motion is scaled up by exactly the same factor for the same reason. For small angles, sin(x) = x. Since the distance traveled at the end of the lever arm is , defining a torque as and then applying it over angle gives you . Then you get the equation but is torque, and for tiny angles, so it becomes .Springs are elastic, meaning that they can be stretched and will then return to their original shape. The more you deform them, the harder they resist. This leads to Hooke's Law, which says that the restoring force of a spring is proportional to the distance it's been deformed: . is the spring constant, which is a number that basically says "for every distance you stretch the spring, it will be this much harder to keep going." The unit of is , which makes sense (newtons per meter), but it simplifies to the weird unit , which is very non-intuitive.Springs have an elastic limit, which is the point where they can't recover from being deformed any farther. If you moosh a spring past its elastic limit, you will leave a permanent change in it. As long as you stay within the elastic limit, the spring can last essentially forever, barring the effects of other parts of the real world (like corrosion and metal impurities).If you put a weight on the end of a spring and then give it a bump so that it bounces up and down, it will keep bouncing back and forth for quite a while (in a perfectly elastic spring without friction, it would go forever). This is a visual demonstration of conversion back and forth between kinetic energy and elastic potential energy. The kinetic energy of the weight is enough to pull the spring past its neutral point, but the force increases and the weight does work to stretch the spring. That work is stored as elastic potential energy in the spring, and once all of the kinetic energy is spent, that potential energy gets released as the spring returns toward neutral and accelerates the weight in the other direction. However, by the time it gets to neutral again, the weight is going at its top speed, so the cycle just has to repeat in the other direction, and it keeps going until friction kills it.So, what happens with momentum in that situation? Clearly the mass gains momentum as it moves, and the momentum must be transferred somewhere because it's conserved. Where does it come from and where does it go? The answer is simply that it comes from whatever the spring is attached to, and it goes right back there. Imagine that one end of the spring is attached to a massive cannon ball, and the other is attached to a little steel marble. The whole contraption is floating in space. Now you pull the marble to get it moving back and forth. You'll see the marble move much farther than the cannon ball, but both of them will be moving in response to the force from the spring. The cannon ball is moving so slowly and such a small amount that its kinetic energy is barely changing (remember kinetic energy equals the force times the distance moved, which is basically zero here), but its momentum will exactly match the marble's.]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons-outline.html</link><guid

The startup friction of class planning overwhelmed me because I am currently teaching an entire highschool and an entire middle school curriculum. This is how I am using obsidian to make it possible (hopefully).
Templater
Dataview
Modal forms
Obsidian Kanban
Natural Language Dates
The basic idea is this: I need to have a way to be prompted for everything that goes into a lesson plan, automatically. It needs to give me links to all of the resources I'm working with, and pointers to where and how to search for specific things to add in. I need to link this with an outline of the course that is easy to track and manage, so that each topic I'm covering tells me what books and other stuff I need to have ready and what topics I need to brush up on. All of the stuff should be right in front of me when I sit down to plan.First, outline the main sequence your course is going to follow. I like to have a textbook for this because someone else did the hard work of organizing and selecting the material that needs to be covered. If there isn't a book, I look for some other resource for sequencing. Otherwise, it's a lot more work.Once you have the basic outline, you need to design the lessons. I don't find much value in outlining a lesson in terms of what I cover, as much as outlining it in terms of what I'm going to use while I teach it. Generally I don't need to be reminded about formulas and other details once I've seen them at least recently, but if there's something I want to be sure to get right I'll put a note there.Far more important is to find additional resources like videos and structured lab activities, and to make myself checklists for getting all of that crap together.So, after I have a basic idea of what the lessons need to have, I make a template. The template is specific to the class and it has all of the links to all of the things I use while planning lessons.Next make a modal form that has answers for things that you need to fill in for the lesson. The things I've been using are:
Topics that I'm going to cover
Web resources like videos and simuators
Page numbers in the textbooks
The scheduled date for the lesson
List of guided practice problems
Link to any active project for the class
The template takes that data and makes a note out of it. It generates a few extra things to help as well:
Search links for youtube and google for every topic being covered
Link back to the class index page
I'm trying out a kanban for the class index page, treating it like a project with tasks and an overall goal. We'll see how it goes, but initially I like having the long list of checkboxes presented in a more screen-efficient way. The downside of the kanban is that I can't put anything other than the plan into it, so all of my resource links and planning notes have to be in another file. There might be some use in making a special task list for just resources and notes that isn't meant to be "completed". I'll try that to see how it works.All of this is basically just here to force me to remember all of the little parts that have to come together every time to make a working lesson. It's too easy to fall into the trap of just winging it, especially for topics that I already know really well. That's not good enough though. I'm hoping that having this planning tool will make the friction of actually making a real plan low enough for me to do it consistently every day.One feature of the forms is that they can have required fields. I'm using those as a prod for my future self in cases like the guided practice questions - the lesson isn't complete unless I have some guided practice questions planned. That forces me to look through the problems and subject material and actually pick out some things to do interactively in class. ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/obsidian-mastery.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/obsidian-mastery.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[obsidian-school-vault]]></title><description><![CDATA[The school sharing system from last year was clunky and annoying, so I want to switch it up this year.

Let's try it: use the laser to cut out 20 accurately-sized circles of paper. Weigh them and divide by 20. That will tell us how much paper it takes to make a circle of that diameter. Now, since we know that the area of a circle should be , we can divide by . If we weight a ream of paper and divide by its total area, we can get a nice number for the the weight of a certain area of paper, so if we divide the current result by that, we should get..... PI!
constructing regular polygons construct regular heptagon Constructing these shapes is cool, but it gives you more than just the ability to make the shape. Remember that regular polygons have internal and external angles with known measures; that means that you can now construct angles with any of those measures! So, if you ever need a 108 angle, you just need to construct enough of a pentagon to get the first corner and edges defined, and you have exactly what you need.You can also take half- and quarter- angles of all of these, which gives you even more options.<br>Follow the textbook examples and use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.geogebra.org/geometry?lang=en/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.geogebra.org/geometry?lang=en/" target="_self">GeoGebra geometry construction tools</a> to construct:

To do a high-quality proof or other complex problem, it's important to put some comments in your math-code, so to speak. The way we're going to do that is with a two-column proof format. Start by reading the problem and identifying things that will probably need to be variables. You'll definitely want variables for the desired unknown, and you'll want more variables for anything else that's either unknown or changing as part of the problem.
Write your variable names down along with a specific explanation of what they represent (e.g. x: The number of jelly donuts sold)
In the first rows of the table, write down any equations you can glean from the statement of the problem and label them given. These would be things like for the jelly donuts problem below.
Now you have to think about how to make use of all of the data in the problem, and for a proof in particular you need to look for extra relationships you might be able to exploit. These will typically be in the form of equations the connect parts of the problem together. Write these into the table along with their justifications.
Start doing the math. If you end up needing other results, just add them to the table right where you're at and make a little notation to the side.
Every step that invokes a non-trivial concept needs to have a comment to the right explaining why you're allowed to do it. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-basic-geometry-concepts/section/2.7/primary/lesson/two-column-proofs-bsc-geom/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-basic-geometry-concepts/section/2.7/primary/lesson/two-column-proofs-bsc-geom/" target="_self">several worked examples</a>

What was better about life during this time?
What was worse?
How people's experiences of the industrial revolution differ? Who benefited? Was anyone worse off after? How?
In today's world, we're currently in the middle of the "AI Revolution." If it works like the Industrial revolution did, who will be making the money from it? Who will be poorer for it, at least in the short term? What do you think is likely to happen as a result, based on this example?

The Meiji Restoration started with the overthrow of the Shogun, then created major changes to keep Japanese culture from being overrun by Europeans.
abolish feudalism
Constitutional monarchy like Prussia (emperor rules through subordinate political leader)
equality before law, abolish cruel punishments
reoganized military to be like Prussian
Created a school system
built railroads
subsidized industrialization
All in 50 years.

Stockholders and stock markets Monopoly - one corporation with enough power to completely dominate a market, making it impossible to buy from anyone else and therefore having power to charge high prices Insurance - pay a fee to have someone cover risk The rise of leisure, consumerism, and sports This period of history brought enormous change, and it's hard to keep the ideology of different places separate from their ascendant power. Imagine a world in which the Ottoman Empire, or China, had been first to adopt the industrial technologies - how might the rest of history been changed since that time? Consider the differences in culture between those societies and modern western culture. Technology is just a tool, it could have been used to spread any of the world's ideologies.

Which of the following maritime technologies was adopted by European explorers from other cultures? (A) The astrolabe
(B) The caravel
(C) The gunpowder cannon
(D) The lateen sail
Correct Answer: (D) The lateen sail. Explanation: Europeans adopted the lateen sail from Arab sailors. The lateen sail was triangular and could catch winds coming from many different directions. This made European ships more maneuverable and allowed for sailing against the wind. The astrolabe was a navigational tool developed in the classical era (c. 600 BCE–c. 600 CE) and used to determine latitude by measuring the altitude of the sun or the stars. Gunpowder cannons and caravels were both developed in Europe. Topic 4.2: Exploration (c. 1450 to c. 1750)
Which European explorer is credited with being the first to circumnavigate the globe? (A) Christopher Columbus
(B) Bartolomeu Dias
(C) Ferdinand Magellan
(D) Vasco da Gama
Correct Answer: (C) Ferdinand Magellan. Explanation: Although Ferdinand Magellan was killed in the Philippines, his expedition was the first to circumnavigate the globe. Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the Americas. Bartolomeu Dias was the first European explorer to sail around the southern tip of Africa. Vasco da Gama was the first European explorer to sail from Europe to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Topic 4.3: Columbian Exchange
Which of the following describes a key consequence of the Columbian Exchange? (A) The introduction of new diseases to the Americas led to a dramatic decline in the Native American population.
(B) The introduction of European crops to the Americas led to an immediate increase in agricultural productivity.
(C) The introduction of African slaves to the Americas led to the development of new religious practices.
(D) The introduction of horses to the Americas had little effect on Native American societies. Correct Answer: (A) The introduction of new diseases to the Americas led to a dramatic decline in the Native American population. Explanation: The introduction of European diseases to the Americas, including smallpox, measles, and influenza, had a devastating effect on Native American populations. These diseases had a much higher mortality rate among Native Americans than among Europeans. While the introduction of horses to the Americas did transform warfare and hunting for some Native American groups, this was not a key consequence of the Columbian Exchange. The introduction of African slaves to the Americas resulted from the decline in Native American labor and resulted in the development of new, syncretic forms of religion. Topic 4.4: Maritime Empires (c. 1450 to c. 1750) Which of the following best describes the economic system of mercantilism? (A) Colonies were expected to export raw materials to the mother country and import manufactured goods.
(B) Colonies were expected to develop their own industries and trade freely with other countries.
(C) Colonies were expected to provide military support to the mother country but were otherwise allowed to govern themselves.
(D) Colonies were expected to convert to the religion of the mother country and abandon their native faiths. Correct Answer: (A) Colonies were expected to export raw materials to the mother country and import manufactured goods. Explanation: Mercantilism was an economic system in which colonies existed primarily to benefit the mother country. Colonies were expected to provide the mother country with raw materials and markets for manufactured goods. Which of the following was a major consequence of the Atlantic slave trade? (A) The development of new, syncretic religious practices in the Americas
(B) A decrease in interregional trade networks
(C) The decline of European colonial empires
(D) The development of the encomienda system Correct Answer: (A) The development of new, syncretic religious practices in the Americas. Explanation: The Atlantic slave trade led to the development of new syncretic religious practices, such as Vodun, Santeria, and Candomblé in the Americas. Enslaved Africans combined elements of their traditional religions with Christianity. This trade actually resulted in the expansion of interregional trade networks and the intensification of the encomienda system, a system of forced labor in Spanish America. The Atlantic slave trade was a critical component of European colonial empires. Topic 4.5: Maritime Empires Develop Which of the following maritime empires developed a trading-post empire? (A) The British Empire
(B) The Dutch Empire
(C) The French Empire
(D) The Spanish Empire Correct Answer: (B) The Dutch Empire. Explanation: The Dutch established a trading-post empire in the Indian Ocean. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) set up trading posts in key locations to control the spice trade. The British, French, and Spanish developed more traditional empires based on territorial conquest. Which of the following was a major change in labor systems that occurred in the Americas during this era? (A) Indentured servitude declined as enslaved Africans became a more important source of labor.
(B) The mita system was developed in British North America.
(C) The encomienda system was abolished in all Spanish colonies.
(D) European settlers largely relied on their own labor to produce agricultural goods. Correct Answer: (A) Indentured servitude declined as enslaved Africans became a more important source of labor. Explanation: As the demand for labor in the Americas increased, indentured servitude declined as enslaved Africans became a more prominent source of labor. The mita system, which was a system of forced labor in the Inca Empire, was adapted by the Spanish to extract silver from the mines in Potosi. The encomienda system was gradually replaced by other forms of coercive labor, such as the hacienda system. Topic 4.6: Challenges to State Power
Which of the following was a major challenge to state power in the Americas during this era? (A) The Fronde, a series of uprisings against the French monarchy, spread to the French colonies in North America.
(B) The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in present-day New Mexico was a successful revolt against Spanish rule.
(C) Metacom's War, also known as King Philip's War, was a series of conflicts between the English colonists and Native Americans in New England, but it did not pose a serious threat to English rule.
(D) The Gloucester County Rebellion was a successful revolt by enslaved Africans in Virginia that led to the abolition of slavery in the colony. Correct Answer: (B) The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in present-day New Mexico was a successful revolt against Spanish rule. Explanation: The Pueblo Revolt was a successful revolt by Pueblo Indians against Spanish rule. The Pueblo were able to drive the Spanish out of New Mexico for 12 years. Metacom's War and the Gloucester County Rebellion were both unsuccessful. While the Fronde was a series of uprisings against the French monarchy, they were not connected to French colonial efforts in North America. Topic 4.7: Changing Social Hierarchies
Which of the following best describes the casta system in Spanish America? (A) A rigid social hierarchy that placed people of European descent at the top.
(B) A flexible social system that allowed for social mobility based on wealth and education.
(C) A system of governance in which local communities elected their own leaders.
(D) A legal system based on the principles of equality and justice. Correct Answer: (A) A rigid social hierarchy that placed people of European descent at the top. Explanation: The casta system was a complex and rigid social hierarchy based on race and place of birth. People of Spanish descent born in Spain (peninsulares) were at the top of the social hierarchy. Topic 4.8: Continuity and Change in the Role of Women
Which of the following best describes the impact of European colonization on the role of women in indigenous societies? (A) Women in indigenous societies gained political and economic power as a result of European influence.
(B) The role of women in indigenous societies remained largely unchanged as a result of European colonization.
(C) Women in indigenous societies were often marginalized as a result of European patriarchal practices.
(D) Women in indigenous societies played a key role in facilitating trade with European colonists. Correct Answer: (C) Women in indigenous societies were often marginalized as a result of European patriarchal practices. Explanation: European patriarchal practices led to the marginalization of women in many indigenous societies. For instance, the introduction of new legal codes and property rights often limited women’s economic opportunities. In many cases, the disruption of traditional social structures by European colonists also led to a decline in women's status. ]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/history/lessons/unit-4-lesson-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/history/lessons/unit-4-lesson-1.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[unit-4-lesson-2]]></title><description><![CDATA[ scheduledJanuary 14, 2025 <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="history-2024" data-href="history-2024" href="projects/school-fall-2024/history/history-2024.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">START HERE: History 2024 class plan</a>

Italy controls trade with the East, but Europe wants better access. They send explorers.
Want to claim territory (and its wealth) first
Want to spread their religions
Want to gain in power Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) became the first European monarch to sponsor seafaring expeditions, to search for an all-water route to the east as well as for African gold. Under him, Portugal began importing enslaved Africans by sea, replacing the overland slave trade.

The Enlightenment ideals caused people around the world to believe that there could be a better life with a different social structure. Many of them saw revolution as the only way to achieve it, and there were many revolutions during this time. Some succeeded, but many ultimately failed.The driving ideals were progress, reason, and natural law.Natural Law: (my definition) The minimal law that is required for a large number of humans to coexist and resolve their disputes without violence. It's the only law that can both prevent violence when followed, and requires violence when it is broken (as there is no other way to punish people who violate the social contract other than forcing them against their will).
American revolution: 7/4/1776 - 1783 (successful)
New Zealand wars: Maori fighting the British, unsuccessful by 1872
French Revolution: Gov spending too much, calls meeting. Commoners break off into National Assembly because they had no voting power
Storming the Bastille, peasant uprising, king forced to cede gov to National Assembly
Abolition of feudalism, adoption of Declaration of the Rights of Man
Reign of Terror - revolutionary gov executes thousands of opponents, including king and queen, many with the guillotine. Haitian Revolution Extremely violent

Please ask one question, then wait for my response, and finally evaluate my response and provide constructive feedback. Questions should be a mixture of short-answer open-ended questions and multiple choice. Focus on the causes and effects, as well as the connections between events and entities in the unit. After providing feedback, please ask me if I would like to continue answering questions. If I answer yes, generate another question according to this structure.Please create a list of 10 multiple choice questions covering The unit or section in question. Each question should have four possible answers. Two of the answers should be easily recognized as incorrect, one answer should be almost correct but wrong because of the consequences of the events described in the unit, and one answer should be correct. Please provide the correct answer along with explanations of why each option was either correct or incorrect.Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in the unit in question. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on the associations between systems and entities in the source material, not just fact recall. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.
Kids do the reading and answer MCQ and short answer ahead of class. (due Mondays and Thursdays)
Kids make flashcards for the data they gather from the book and videos.
We watch the heimler video in class. (Mondays and Thursdays)

Bureaucracy “Under the Mughals, Hindus and Muslims interacted in economics, politics, social life, the arts, and culture. Through migration and conversion, the Muslim population of India grew from about 400,000 in 1200, . . . to 12.8 million in 1535, to perhaps 50 million by 1800. Muslim scholars and Sufi religious mystics and saints migrated to India from Iran, Turkey, and Central Asia. Some came in search of government jobs, others for new cultural opportunities, to study, or to spread their own beliefs. Some of the best poets immigrated from Persia.
Similarly, imperial court painters, who produced masterpieces in the Persian and Mughal miniature styles, interacted with painters of the Rajput schools in local Hindu courts across north India, resulting in artistic innovations in both. On the level of mystical belief and experience, an astonishing syncretism emerged between Hindus and Muslims, especially in the poetry of Kabir [died circa 1520] and of Guru Nanak (1469–1538), the originator of the Sikh religion. Mystics in the two communities, Hindu bhakti (devotional) worshippers and Muslim Sufis, frequently had warm personal relations and often attracted followers from each others’ communities.” Howard Spodek and Michele Langford Louro, United States historians, article published in a scholarly journal, 2007 Using the excerpt, respond to parts a, b, and c.
a. Identify ONE claim that the authors make in the first paragraph.
b. Identify ONE piece of evidence that the authors use to support their claims about cultural interactions between Hindus and Muslims as described in the second paragraph.
c. Explain ONE reason why Mughal rulers in the period circa 1450–1750 would have encouraged the interactions described in the passage.
Great land-based empires existed before 1450 and after 1750. However, between these years, several of history’s greatest land-based empires reached their peak of wealth and influence. Among these were the Songhai in West Africa the Safavids based in Persia the Mughals in northern India the Ottomans in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa and the Manchus in eastern Asia. They were multiethnic states that had direct political control over large regions and overland trade routes.

Please provide the correct answer along with explanations of why each option was either correct or incorrect.Here is a list of 10 multiple choice questions covering Unit 3 of the sources: What was one consequence of the introduction of new crops from the Americas to Europe? a) The population of Europe declined due to diseases spread through the Columbian Exchange.
b) Europeans became overly reliant on potatoes, leading to the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.
c) New crops led to population growth and new dietary options in Europe.
d) The introduction of American crops created severe environmental degradation in Europe due to overfarming. Explanation: The introduction of new crops like potatoes and maize from the Americas to Europe led to population growth and new dietary options. Option (a) is incorrect because the Columbian Exchange did spread diseases, but it also led to population growth in Europe. (b) is incorrect because the Irish Potato Famine occurred much later. Option (d) is incorrect because overfarming was a larger issue in the Americas than in Europe. Akbar the Great, the Mughal ruler, is known for his policy of religious tolerance. Which action best exemplifies this policy? a) He persecuted members of the Sikh religion.
b) He forced Hindus to convert to Islam.
c) He promoted the synthesis of Islam with Hinduism, creating a new religion called Din-i Ilahi.
d) He eliminated the jizya tax on non-Muslims, demonstrating acceptance of different faiths. Explanation: Akbar's elimination of the jizya, a tax on non-Muslims, is a clear example of his policy of religious tolerance. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they contradict his policy. Option (c) is partially correct, as Akbar did attempt to create a syncretic religion, but it was not a primary example of his tolerance towards existing religions. The Ottoman devshirme system involved: a) The enslavement of African people for labor on plantations.
b) The recruitment of Christian boys who were converted to Islam and trained for military or administrative service.
c) The practice of tax farming, where individuals collected taxes for the state in exchange for a share of the revenue.
d) The construction of lavish palaces like the Taj Mahal to demonstrate the power and wealth of the empire. Explanation: The devshirme system was a unique practice in the Ottoman Empire where Christian boys were taken, converted to Islam, and trained for elite roles. Option (a) describes a different form of slavery. Options (c) and (d) are related to Ottoman practices but not to the devshirme system. Which statement best describes the economic relationship between Spain and its American colonies during the 16th and 17th centuries? a) The colonies traded freely with other European powers, enriching themselves and undermining Spanish control.
b) Spain extracted vast amounts of silver from its colonies, enriching the Spanish crown and stimulating the European economy.
c) The colonies developed strong manufacturing industries, competing with Spain and ultimately declaring independence.
d) Spain primarily sought agricultural products from its colonies, neglecting the potential for mineral wealth. Explanation: Spain's colonial economy was heavily reliant on the extraction of silver from its American colonies. This wealth enriched Spain but also had global consequences. Option (a) is incorrect as Spain maintained strict control over colonial trade. Options (c) and (d) are not accurate representations of the economic dynamics of the Spanish Empire. The Atlantic slave trade had a profound impact on the Americas. Which statement best characterizes its effects? a) It led to the widespread adoption of indigenous labor systems like the mit'a.
b) It resulted in the equitable distribution of wealth among European colonists.
c) It contributed to the rise of industrial capitalism in Europe, but did not significantly impact the Americas.
d) It led to the forced migration of millions of Africans, creating a system of racialized chattel slavery and shaping the social and economic landscape of the Americas. Explanation: The Atlantic slave trade resulted in the horrific forced migration of millions of Africans, creating lasting racial and social divisions in the Americas. Option (a) is incorrect because the slave trade replaced indigenous labor systems. Option (b) is incorrect because wealth was concentrated among European elites. Option (c) is partially correct, as the slave trade contributed to European wealth, but its impact on the Americas was undeniable. Which European monarch broke with the Catholic Church and established a national church in England during the 16th century? a) Louis XIV

Which statement best describes the impact of the Columbian Exchange on indigenous populations in the Americas? a) It led to rapid population growth due to the introduction of new food crops.
b) It resulted in the deaths of millions of indigenous people due to diseases like smallpox.
c) It had a minimal impact, as indigenous populations were largely isolated from European contact.
d) It led to the blending of indigenous and European cultures, creating a harmonious society. Explanation: The Columbian Exchange had a devastating impact on indigenous populations in the Americas, primarily due to the introduction of European diseases like smallpox. Option (a) is incorrect because the exchange led to population decline, not growth. Options (c) and (d) do not accurately reflect the significant and often destructive impact of the exchange. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) was an agreement between which two European powers to divide newly discovered lands? a) England and France
b) Spain and Portugal
c) The Netherlands and Spain
d) France and Portugal Explanation: The Treaty of Tordesillas was a significant agreement between Spain and Portugal to divide the world outside of Europe.

c) The Ming Dynasty prohibited all maritime exploration, fearing the influence of foreign cultures.
d) The Ming Dynasty focused exclusively on trade with Japan, ignoring opportunities in the Indian Ocean. Explanation: The Ming Dynasty, under Emperor Yongle, initially sponsored large-scale maritime voyages led by Zheng He, but later shifted priorities towards internal development.

You'll be given a sentence kernel, which is a clause that expresses a fact or idea about something we've studied. Your job is to use that kernel as the first clause in three separate sentences. Each sentence will have one of the three subordinating conjunctions from the list (because, but, so), followed by a statement of your own that elaborates on the original sentence kernel.Example:James Holden famously loves coffee, {because, but, so}...
James Holden famously loves coffee, because he grew up with it on Earth and it reminds him of home.
James Holden famously loves coffee, but that's not the only liquid he's willing to drink.
James Holden famously loves coffee, so having him destroy the coffee maker in a fit of rage was a strong scene that effectively showed just how angry and frustrated he had become.

There are four types to work with:
Declarative: This is the usual "state the facts, please" kind of sentence.
Imperative: This sentence makes a request ("do this...") or gives advice ("you should...")
Interrogative: Ask a question of the reader. These are usually rhetorical questions, meaning that you're going to answer it yourself.
Exclamatory: Express force or a strong emotion, using a exclamation mark. Use these sparingly, but a well placed exclamation is sometimes just the thing you need!

parts of a sentence (words, phrases, clauses) Phrase missing subject or verb
Clause has subject and verb Noun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition (expresses relationship)
Independent clause: can stand as sentence
Dependent clause, depends on other words or phrases Noun clause acts like noun
Adjective clause acts like adjective
Adverb clause acts like adverb Sentence expresses complete idea. Always has subject and verb, can add phrases and clauses.
Simple sentence: one independent clause
Compound sentence: two or more independent clauses
Complex sentence: one independent and 1+ dependent
Compound complex: two independent, 1+ dependent Conjunction: words that link
Coordinating conjunctions: Connect independent clauses.
Subordinating Conjunctions: Connect independent to dependent clauses (p. 6) Misplaced modifier: not clear what word describes because it's in the wrong placed.

(See what I did there?)A subordinating conjuction sticks a clause onto the end of another clause in a way that makes it depend on the first one. Doing that makes the connection between the ideas clear, which helps your reader keep things in working memory long enough to understand your idea. It's particularly helpful to do this in topic and conclusion sentences, because those are the places where you're trying to communicate the most complex ideas in your writing.Good practice for this: because, but, so exercises. Make a sentence kernel, which is a clause that expresses a simple idea. Use that kernel to generate three complex sentences, one for each of the subordinating conjunctions because, but, and so.Example: Frogs are different from toads, {because, but, so} ...Frogs are different from toads, because they have to survive under very different levels of moisture and food availability.
Frogs are different from toads, but they share many behavioral and morphological traits that stem from a common evolutionary ancestry.
Frogs are different from toads, so anyone who wishes to keep them as pets will need to pay close attention to their environmental and nutritional needs.]]></description><link>projects/school-fall-2024/language/language-review/subordinating-conjunctions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">projects/school-fall-2024/language/language-review/subordinating-conjunctions.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:54:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[8-reference-materials]]></title><description><![CDATA[

using a dictionary
using a thesaurus
using wikipedia
citations Sort this list of words in alphabetical order: aardvaark, aaron, bohemian, behemoth, axe, bohemia Look up the definition of bohemian A dictionary tells you what a word means, and a thesaurus tells you what other words you can use in place of a word. When you're writing, you'll frequently be searching for just the right word to convey not only a direct meaning, but also a subtext and implication that all align with the idea you're trying to express. Using the thesaurus to explore similar words is a good way to solve this problem. A dictionary is more useful when reading, so that you can look up unfamiliar words and understand what's being said. However, it's also good to occasionally look up a word you've been using, just to be sure you're using it well and taking full advantage of it's complete meaning.The only actual "skill" involved in using these reference works is understanding how words are sorted so that you can look them up easily. It's very simple:
Start at the first letter in both words.
Compare the current letters. If they're different, the word with the letter that comes earlier in the alphabet is sorted ahead of the other word and you're done.
If they're the same, move to the next letter and repeat step two.
If one word runs out of letters first, it comes before the word that has letters remaining.
When you're writing non-fiction work, you need to be in the habit of giving credit to your sources and leaving your readers with a trail of breadcrumbs that they can use to investigate further into what you wrote. This is done by providing citations - brief blobs of information that list all of the details a reader would need about a source in order to find it and review it. There are three main formats people use for citations:
APA (American Psychological Association)
MLA (Modern Language Association)
Chicago Style (from the University of Chicago press)
We're going to practice each of them over the course of the next few months.

From the ACE book: Using Sentence Starters, p. 20Having a library of sentence starters can help you keep your writing from getting stale and repetitive (or, if you rely too much on it, it might have the opposite effect). If you find yourself struggling to start the next sentence, take a look through these options and see if one of them gives you an idea. You don't have to use them literally as written (except for the 3d6 challenges...), they're just there to give your gray matter a kick and get you out of a rut.Each part of the ACE answer method has a style of sentence that makes the most sense. These are just some examples, and you can fall back on them when you're running into trouble getting words on the page.You have to answer the question in a well-written short paragraph, but each sentence must be started with a selection from this table chosen at random by rolling 1d6 for each part of the answer. No cheating!Rules:
Start by rolling 3d6. These are your numbers, and you can't change them.
Assign one die to each column. That will determine what sentence starters you must use for that section of your response.
Write your response using those sentence starters!

Read ACE p. 133 "Too plugged in"
Elaboration by explaining why the evidence they chose is relevant to the answer.
From the ACE book: lesson 5, Using the Explain Why strategy.Elaboration is the hardest part of making a good short response. It's fairly easy to make an answer and pull a bit of evidence from somewhere for it, but beyond that people tend to run dry. We're going to talk over several strategies for elaborating your answers, and the first one is "Explain Why." It's the easiest, you already know how to do it, and it applies almost everywhere. We're mostly just giving it a name here.Explain why just means that you explain why the evidence you cited before is relevant to the question at hand. Often, you're assuming that your audience knows the connection between them because it seems obvious, but the reality is that they are probably either distract and disengaged, or they actually don't know! You can pull them back into the topic by building the bridge for them: Tell them why the stuff you said was evidence actually is evidence that matters. Bad Example: "He's guilty. The diamonds were found in his car. They were in his car, so he's guilty."
That example is bad because it doesn't actually make any connection between the evidence and the answer, and it doesn't explain anything. It gives you the feeling that you're explaining, but no new information was provided and nothing about the "explanation" actually cleared anything up.Better example: "He's guilty. The diamonds were found in his car. We have video footage of him with his car near the time and place of the theft, so finding the diamonds in the car indicates he is the one who stole them."
This is better because it actually connects the fact of finding them in a person's car with the person (otherwise, maybe his friend was borrowing his car, or maybe somebody is trying to frame him...)Read this artcle below, quoted from "ACE Short-response writing," then answer the questions:Too Plugged-inIn today's world, screens are nearly everywhere. Computers and smartphones connect us with friends or help us do research for school projects. In fact, some health experts say watching TV or playing video games can be relaxing. But many kids spend a lot more time on these devices than they should. On average, American kids spend about seven hours a day in front of screens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is a leading group of doctors. It says that all that extra screen time could lead to problems like weight gain, lower grades in school, and trouble sleeping.David Greenfield is an expert on how people use technology. He says that time spent playing video games is time not spent being active. "If you spend 8, 9, 10 hours a day gaming, the only thing you're moving is your finger," says Greenfield.
Being surrounded by screens can also make it hard to focus on one task. In a 2013 study, experts in California studied students as they did their homework. After just two minutes, many kids started surfing the internet, watching TV, or texting instead of focusing on their assignments.
Too much screen time at night can also cause kids to lose out on sleep. Studies have shown that playing video games or using other digital devices right before bedtime can keep kids tossing and turning all night. The light from the screen tricks the brain into thinking it's still daytime.The AAP says kids should limit their screen time to no more than two hours a day. One way kids can limit their screen time is by taking plenty of screen breaks during the day. Kids could use those breaks to rest their brains or exercise.

From the ACE book: Lesson 1, introducing ACE, p. 13ACE stands for Answer, Cite, Elaborate. Answer: After thinking about the question, what would you answer?
Cite: Now that you have your answer, what evidence can you bring up to support your choice?
Elaborate: Explain more about why your evidence supports your choice, and why your overall answer is significant.
ACE is a way to make higher-quality short responses to questions. Rather than just answering with a one-word barely-adequate response, you think a bit more deeply about it and provide some reasons and some explanation about why you chose your answer. Responding like this makes you think more deeply about things, which is good all by itself, and it also opens the door for conversation and maybe even changing of minds. One-word answers are conversation killers, but explanations and evidence give people something to work with.Template for ACE answer building:
I think insert answer here
One reason is: add evidence to support your answer
This is significant because: why does your evidence matter? Ask a rhetorical question
Explain things that your reader might not already know
Explain source and author: Where did your evidence come from, who said it, and why are they authoritative?
If you use a quote, explain what it means and why it's relevant. DON'T JUST RESTATE WHAT THE QUOTE SAID! Any keywords or concepts your reader might not understand? Explain them.
Did you explain after your rhetorical questions?
Did you explain the credibility of the author, source, and quote?
Did you answer all of the reader's questions?
Are you redundant?
Do you fully prove your point?
Only now do you check spelling and grammar. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjyYo6RLeDc" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjyYo6RLeDc" target="_self">Mister Messinger: How to elaborate your ideas</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ACE%20Method%20of%20short%20response%20answers" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ACE%20Method%20of%20short%20response%20answers" target="_self">Youtube search for "ACE Method for short response answers"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=answer%20the%20question,%20cite%20evidence,%20elaborate%20your%20thinking" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=answer%20the%20question,%20cite%20evidence,%20elaborate%20your%20thinking" target="_self">Youtube search for "answer the question, cite evidence, elaborate your thinking"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (lang) ACE Exercise: What habit do you think is most important for a successful student? <a data-href="2025-01-31" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-01-31</a>

Appositive vs relative clauses
An appositive is a noun, or a phrase or clause that works like a noun, that is used to further explain another noun. The only complication you'll likely run into is recognizing the difference between an appositive and a relative clause. So, here's the quick explanation:
An appositive can be removed from a sentence without breaking the sentence's structure
An appositive is almost always set off with commas and comes after the noun.
A relative clause starts with a relative pronoun: who, which, that, whose whom. Appositives do not
A relative clause has a verb, appositives usually don't. Marcus Aurelius, a Roman Emperor famous for his writings on stoic philosophy, ruled from A.D 161 to 180.

I think it's just establishing how ordinary and scatterbrained the characters are.Holden is a very sharp observer of people. He notices things, like the way Jane Gallagher liked to line up her kings in checkers because they looked nice.This is a guy who's looking back on life and feeling the loss and missing the way things were, but he's trying to get through it by acting like it's all worthless and who cares anyway? sour grapes, but in a self-defense kind of way. He is sad about the way things turned out and he misses Pencey.He cared about Jean, and was mad that Stradlater took advantage of her.These first chapters are laying out the tone of the story. Holden is a screwup who is getting kicked out of Pencey, which is a high school in the northeast united states somewhere. He regrets how things went, but when he looks back on it he can't help but make everything look as bad as possible in order to make the loss of it sting less. We met a few characters, all of whom were described in great detail by someone who clearly has an understanding of people. Ackley, a slovenly older boy who has bad manners, Stradlater, a jock who is full of himself, and Mr Spencer, the old history teacher who Holden goes to visit right at the start. His writing is loaded with references to "people who do that kind of thing," but then he criticizes "people [who] always think somethings all true." There is a lot of irony in his setup of the world and the situation.

Read 7-13, Catcher in the Rye
Aimlessness, avoiding responsibility
Looking desperately for a distraction (phone calls, dancing with girls, drinking)
Sour grapes everywhere (nothing around him is good enough)
"He's so good it's almost corny. I don't know what I mean by that, but I mean it."
Watching people through the window
He's able to see the bad in everyone, but he himself has similar problems that he doesn't see. He's "one of those guys who always sees the worst, you know?" What bad he does see in himself he uses almost as an excuse, or maybe even a badge of honor. Everyone around me is better than me, so I'm just going to do what I want because it doesn't matter So far, the whole story is about how Holden is trying to eke out the last little bit of freedom before he goes back to his parents' and faces the consequences of getting kicked out of Pencey. It feels like a kind of "what would you do if the world was ending tomorrow?" scenario, but all of his plans fall apart because of poor execution, or because he's got such a negative attitude.We have an essay coming up, so it's time to start thinking about topics and making notes for it. Here are a few possible essay questions:
Think about Holden’s vision of the nature of childhood and adulthood. Are the two realms as separate as Holden believes them to be? Where does he fit in?
The novel is structured around Holden’s encounters and interactions with other people. Does any pattern seem to emerge, or does anything change in his interactions as the novel progresses? How do Holden’s encounters with adults, children, women, and his peers evolve as the novel progresses?
Throughout the book, Holden longs for intimacy with other human beings. Discuss the different types of relationships Holden attempts and the different types of intimacy in the book. What is the role of sexuality in The Catcher in the Rye? How do Holden’s sexual relationships differ from his nonsexual encounters? 4. The most ambiguous encounter in the book is Holden’s night at Mr. Antolini’s apartment. What do you make of Mr. Antolini’s actions? Was he making a pass at Holden? What is the significance of his actions, and how do they relate to his role as someone trying to prevent Holden from “taking a fall”?
Holden often behaves like a prophet or a saint, pointing out the phoniness and wickedness in the world around him. Is Holden as perfect as he wants to be? Are there instances where he is phony and full of hypocrisy? What do these moments reveal about his character and his psychological problems?
How has the interaction between Holden and the rest of the characters evolved throughout the story?
How are the themes of self-understanding and growth portrayed in the book?
Why is Stradlater obliged to comply with all rules?
What religious beliefs are genuine, according to Holden’s thoughts?
Why is Holden obsessed with phoniness and loneliness?
How could one instance affect an entire novel as seen in ‘Catcher in the rye’?
Which cultural and social challenges mentioned are relevant in the modern world?
What things could be the death of Holden in his opinion?
How fair is Holden’s judgment of his community?
How does&nbsp;Holden’s past affect&nbsp;his connection with others? <br><a href=".?query=tag:teacher" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#teacher">#teacher</a> Read catcher chapters 1-6, fill in review questions and other content <a data-href="2025-02-03" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-03</a>

Read Chapter 3 of BFLAN
For 1/27 - Do a bunch of examples! Make sentences passive, make them active, explain why they are one way or the other. active voice passive voice identifying active or passive voice correcting passive voice intransitive verb "My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna was begun." "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me." "The young gentleman was later seen by me in front of the Gare Saint-Lazare." "Midday was struck on the clock. The bus was being got onto by passengers. They were being squashed together. A hat was being worn on the head of a young gentleman, which hat was encircled by a plait and not by a ribbon. A long neck was sported by the young gentleman. The man standing next to him was being grumbled at by the latter because of the jostling which was being inflicted on him by him. As soon as a vacant seat was espied by the young gentleman, it was made the object of his precipitate movements and it became sat down upon." There are two voices we're considering here: active and passive. The main difference is in how the subject and the verb are connected.In an Active voice sentence, the subject does what the verb says. They are active, making something happen.In a Passive voice sentence, something is happening to the subject. They are passive, being affected by something else.Example: Mary ate the pie.This is an active voice sentence, because the subject, Mary, is making the verb happen. We could change it to passive voice like this:The pie was eaten by MaryNotice now that the pie is the subject, and the verb is something that's happening to it.These signs are clues that we might be reading a passive voice sentence. They aren't a guaranteed proof, but they should make you sus.
The verb is past tense (past tense, e.g. helped)
There's a helping verb (be helped, was helped)
It uses by to explain what actually caused the action to happen (The stage hand was helped by the audience).
It's hard to figure out what's actually going on, because passive voice puts the action in reverse of what you expect.
Passive voice usually makes writing harder to understand, and weakens its impact. It's not always a bad thing, but you should be careful using it. It's easier to follow an idea when the active party comes before the action because you can immediately visualize what's happening, even before the sentence is complete. The clown honked the horn tells you at the start that a clown is doing something, and later fills in the details. The horn was honked by the clown not only has significantly more words, but it also forces you to remember the details for the entire sentence while you wait for the active party to show up.So if passive voice is only usually a problem, when is it okay? Here's what the BBC says:
Use it when you don't know who the agent is: "My dog was released in the night" instead of "Somebody released my dog in the night." Use it when it doesn't matter who the agent is: "Do you need a ride? No, l will be picked up." Use it when the agent is clearly implied: "She found that she was being paid less then her male coworkers." instead of "She found that the company paid her less than her male coworkers." The Hunger Games was written by Suzanne Collins. This dystopian book is enjoyed by young adults all around the world. In The Hunger Games, a nation of twelve districts, called Panem, is controlled by the Capitol. Each year, twenty-four district children are forced by the Capitol to compete in an event called the Hunger Games, where they fight to the death until only one is left standing. A lottery selects which kids will fight. District 12 is lived in by the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. When her younger sister, Prim, is selected by the lottery as tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place. That year the baker's son Peeta is also chosen by the lottery. Katniss and Peeta are escorted to the Capitol by chaperones.Before the Hunger Games begin, all the tributes train. As they train, the tributes are observed by game makers who want to assess their strengths and weaknesses. Tributes are also interviewed by Caesar Flickerman on national television. If a tribute's interview goes well, gifts from generous viewers might be sent to them to help them survive.

five verb moods
interrogative mood
imperative mood
indicative mood
conditional mood
subjunctive mood
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/verb-tenses/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/verb-tenses/" target="_self">Verb tenses (past, present, future | simple, perfect, continuous)</a> Indicative mood verbs communicates facts, opinions, and statements.
Imperative mood verbs give commands
Interrogative mood verbs ask questions
Conditional mood verbs describe what would happen if something else happens
Subjunctive mood verbs express a hypothetical (imaginary) situation, wish, dream, hope, or desire, especially if it's unlikely or impossible. Look for "were" and "if", and for suggestions and considerations.
We all know past, present, and future, but what about simple, perfect, continuous, and perfect continuous??
Simple is the most straightforward use of a verb tense. It doesn't add any new information beyond the verb's meaning.
Perfect is related to some other point in time, and is either completed or ongoing. I have played pathfinder for over five years. Look for the have along with a past-tense verb.
Continuous (Progressive) is used for things that will happen for a while before they're done. We'll be studying all night for the test. These usually involve a be verb along with the -ing suffix
Perfect Continuous is a thing that will continue for a time, and that started at some other time. *I will have been flying kites for sixteen hours by the end of the day"
This matters mostly so that you can avoid awkward sentences that have "mood shifts." A mood shift happens when you start a sentence with the verb in one mood, and then switch to a different mood in the same sentence.
Don' t forget to feed the dogs, and you should take them for a walk.
"Don't forget" is imperative, "should take them" is indicative. Instead, the sentence would be better if you stuck with one mood:
Don't forget to feed the dogs and take them for a walk.
The verbs in the different parts of your sentences need to agree - they should have the same mood and tense, otherwise your sentence is weak or even incorrect.

Affixes (things stuck onto words that change their meaning)
Roots - the core meaning of a word
Elaboration using compare and contrast strategy
From the ACE book: 7 - Compare and Contrast strategyWhen you're making an argument for something being better or worse than other things, or you're explaning a difficult idea, you can use the compare and contrast strategy for elaboration. With this strategy, you choose something else that the reader is probably familiar with, and use it as a comparison with your topic. You can list how they are similar and different, and by doing that you help the reader build up a better idea of what your point is.Your sentences will often follow a pattern like this for this strategy:
Most ___, but ___
Unlike ___, ___
___ could have ___, but instead ___
Example: Who is the most interesting character in the Travelers' Gate series?Answer: Kai
Cite: refusal to be master, plays with dolls, and is awesome fighter
Elaborate: Most fighters are flat, but Kai has an interesting storyACE Response: Kai is the most interesting character in Travelers' Gate because of the seeming contradictions in his character. Throughout the story, he is a fearsome fighter, but he loves his little wooden dolls and is a terrible mentor. Unlike most powerful secondary characters, Kai's story of refusing to be the master of Vallenhall and choosing a life of obscurity gives his character depth beyond just being a narrative device to eliminate threats for the protagonist.

On the first day of summer vacation. I was excited to relax and unwind at the
beach with my family. Ate breakfast quickly and dashed to the car. Ready to go!
Riding along in the back seat, the beach suddenly came into view. I couldn't
wait to sink my toes into the sand. We carried all the beach gear to our spot, I
was finally able to relax. I closed my eyes and listened as seagulls squawked
overhead. Crashing on the shore, I could hear the waves. The sun's rays felt
warm on my skin. A gentle breeze blew since ruffled my hair. Next to me, my
brother and teacher planned their sandcastle. We arrived at the beach early the
sandcastle could be gigantic! dangling modifiers

Each week, we'll discuss the reading that was due, and go over annotations, outline, and any vocabulary or other language features we think need some attention.Every week, the following things will be due at the same time as the reading:
A brief (one paragraph) summary of what happened in the story since the last discussion
Your thoughts and reactions about what the story means to you - this is a great book for a reason, it has deeper meaning than just the story itself, so try to figure it out
A list of at least three uncommon or unfamiliar words from the text, with definitions.
An updated outline of the story that will be used to write your final book report.
At the end of the reading, you'll have a week to write a book report. The rough draft will be due on that Tuesday, and the final draft on that Thursday.

Large wheels
Flat, open platform
Dual-lug mount for servo attachment
Movable mounting plates for IR sensors to allow vertical adjustment Lug on left wheel broke when bot fell off table
Caster wheel rotation is limited by protruding screw shafts, need to reverse the screws
Size of bot may make accurate maneuver difficult, because the IR sensors are a long distance from the pivot point. Large wheels
Box-like enclosure
Through-hole mount for servos
Slotted attachment for IR sensors to allow vertical adjustment Redesign required on wheel attachment due to impossibility of assembly initially (no way to reach the screws)
Through-hole mounts for servos are difficult to 3D print due to large bridging requirements over top of hole, had to make big adjustment to account for that
Several problems due to poor bed adhesion on the printer, cause isn't certain but flipping PEI plate has resolved it for now.
We seem to have a problem with either the quality of the fitech fs90r continuous rotation servos They are not still at any value near 90
Their rotation is inconsistent
According to the docs, they should have no motion if the pulse width is 1.5 ms, so maybe we should try servo.writeMicroseconds(1500), and use our map function to manually map the -1...1 interval of speed into the 1000 ... 2000 range of microsecond timings.
I am wondering if continuously writing the value with the servo is causing it to reset its internal timing and messing up the pulse interval and width
Resolution: The servos themselves are the problem. They just don't work well, because they're cheap. We switched to plain DC motors with PWM control and all is well. We have learned that using pin 13 as the input from the IR sensor is not a good idea. The IR sensor seems to put out an analog voltage rather than a digital signal as we expected
Pin 13 has a resistor and LED attached to it on the board, so it has some voltage drop built in
When we're working with signals close to the threshold anyway, it's too hard to tune the IR sensor board with that extra LED load applied. <br><img alt="Pasted image 20250408100121.jpg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/engineering-projects/_resources/pasted-image-20250408100121.jpg" target="_self"> <br><a data-href="2025-02-04" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-02-04</a> Assemble bots, wire and connect battery, and test the drive method.

Evaluate servo design, determine whether we need to switch to L298 motor drive board with gear motors. Do we need to use a power transistor to drive the servos? Arduino has pretty small current limit... Answer: yes, separate power

Must allow an object of up to 7" long, 2 3/4" wide, and 5" tall to pass through unobstructed
Must detect an object as small as a 1/2" diameter steel marble
Must be able to connect at least four gates to a single Arduino. Compile code for arduino
Make sure there are three remaining Digital I/O pins available after fully connecting the gate. (req. d) Measure the height of the sensor. If it is more than 1/2" above the bottom of the track, the test fails. (req c, partial)
Slide a 7" by 2 3/4" by 5" object through the gate, along the 7" axis of the object. The object must not touch the gate at any point. (req b)

Will require one Digital I/O pin per gate to read the signal from the phototransistor
Will need a power transistor and limiting resistor for each LED and have them wired in parallel to keep brightness even.
Optionally, could use a second pin to control the LEDs on each gate independently. This doubles the pin count, but there are plenty to use. Adjusting sensitivity/calibrating the output We have a fixed voltage divider at the moment. It could be replaced with a 10k potentiometer and 5-10k fixed resistor in series to allow for some sensitivity adjustment. So far it hasn't been necessary. Mechanical design to hold the sensor and LED, as well as the mounting hardware and wires.

Don't permanently attach any electronics yet - we may need to load these things up on a shop tool in order to make adjustments to holes for things to fit properly.

This will be different from the ContinuousServo class because we will be directly controlling the actual motor chip, and it'll take three pins: one for forward, one for reverse, and a PWM pin for speed. Here's the API it needs to present:// File: motor_pwm.hpp
#ifndef MOTOR_PWM_HPP
#define MOTOR_PWM_HPP /// This class implements a simple motor control scheme for a DC motor
// being driven by a TB6612fng dual h-bridge. You can configure the
// motor to be in normal or left-handed mode. In left-handed mode, it
// operates in reverse in order to allow you to use the same definition of
// forward for motors that are oriented in opposite directions (i.e. one on
// each side of a chassis to drive the wheels...). //
// Speed ranges from -1 to 1 as a floating point value. The direction of rotation
// is the sign of the number, and the magnitude is mapped from [0...1] -&gt; [0...255]. class MotorPWM {
public: MotorPWM(int fwd_pin, int rev_pin, int speed_pwm_pin); // The new speed ranges from [-1 ... 1], with negative numbers indicating reverse direction from positive. void set_speed(float new_speed); // Set this motor to be "left-handed", meaning that its rotation is reversed from normal void set_left_handed(bool is_left_handed);
}; #endif
Remember that you'll use this code as the basic interface, but your actual class will need to have some member variables to keep track of speed, pin numbers, and direction, and you'll have to write the implementation for each method in a .cpp file.

Use all of the side effects from what's already there to solve the problem, instead of introducing special cases and parts.
Limited or zero special-case handling.
Minimal design - since all of our goals are met by harnessing all of the side-effects, we don't need extra systems in place. In the quest for elegance: Ask yourself, "How can I USE this effect?" instead of, "How can I DEAL WITH this effect?"
When you're designing your way around something, try to think of a way you could put it to work in order to solve another problem instead of just adding a patch to avoid it. We're designing with OnShape, which is a CAD tool that allows us to change our parts just by changing the dimensions we used for constraints. That's called parametric design, because it uses parameters to control the final shape. Having parametric design lets us make parts that are easy to configure, but only if we make the constraints well.So, what kind of constraints are the right kind? They should respect the geometry - if symmetry or overall size is important, constrain it directly rather than relying on it to work out as a result of other constraints
Dimension what's important to the function - this means that hole patterns for mating parts need to be self-contained within the pattern, and then placed on the mating part using a simple positional constraint. Don't dimension every hole independenly of the others if they all depend on each other
Keep independent things separate - Just like you do want to have holes in a pattern laid out relative to each other, you don't want to make positions of separate pieces tangled up with each other. If you're mounting two circuit boards to a panel, make each hole pattern a stand-alone pattern, then position both of them relative to the geometry of the plate independently of each other
<br>Basically, you want to capture dependencies that matter, and not introduce any new ones that aren't actually required for the function of the part! This is an art, and it takes practice. It is well worth the effort though, and it leads to a way of thinking that is closely related to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="classy-tanks" data-href="classy-tanks" href="projects/school-fall-2024/programming/lessons/classy-tanks.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Separation of Concerns</a> that we use in code design.

What's the problem?
What are the discovered requirements that will solve the problem if they are met?
What is the proposed solution?
How long will it take to build?
How much will it cost?
What are future options we might take that didn't make the cut this time, but might make it as we learn more about the problem?
What will the prototype do in order to prove the concept?
How quickly can we have the prototype ready?
Once we have a concept, we should try to prototype it as quickly as possible. In the case of the photogate, we have the circuit and a bit of code, so we have already done part of the prototyping. We need to make it into a device that can detect when an object passes through, so what could we build today that would show that working? We could use cardboard, plywood, construction foam, hot glue, etc. In weather with temperatures below about 30 F, many people will experience chilling of the skin on the head and ears. This is uncomfortable, and we will create a device that will help alleviate this discomfort.
The device must help keep the head and ears warm even in very cold weather
The device must be comfortable enough to use for long periods
The device must be cleanable, as contact with skin will inevitably leave it dirty
We will create a specially-shaped blanket, designed to fit over the top of the head snugly enough to keep itself in place, but not so snugly as to cause discomfort. The blanket material will be a knitted fabric that is both elastic and highly insulating, and it will be dense enough to block moderate breezes.The initial prototype will be complete within an hour, as all that is required is to wrap a piece of the material around the head and check to see that it does indeed keep the noggin toasty. The prototype will allow us to ensure that the device works as expected, and it will also help us finalize some of the choices for design options that did not make the cut this time. Once the concept is proven, creation of a finished device will take around two hours.Cost: Total cost of materials will be approximately $4. Cost of engineering time will be approximately $10,000, with flexibility for additional design effort as needed.Some additional design options were considered during this process. If this design is found to be inadequate, we may try some of the following:
make the sides long enough to cuff once, in order to double the thickness over the ears
Add some decorative tassles for extra rizz.
Add a chin strap for use in very windy conditions
Add a semi-rigid brim above the eyes to help shade from bright light, such as that put off by the Sun. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stages%20of%20engineering%20design" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stages%20of%20engineering%20design" target="_self">Youtube search for "stages of engineering design"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=concept%20generation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=concept%20generation" target="_self">Youtube search for "concept generation"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=prototyping" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=prototyping" target="_self">Youtube search for "prototyping"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=discovering%20requirements" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=discovering%20requirements" target="_self">Youtube search for "discovering requirements"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=defining%20the%20problem" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=defining%20the%20problem" target="_self">Youtube search for "defining the problem"</a> <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (engr) In class and finishing by end of next class: Write a short design proposal for a drinking cup that follows the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/engineering-process" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/engineering-process" target="_self">guide in the notes</a> above <a data-href="2025-01-16" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-01-16</a>

First, write the state machine as a simple switch statement so that you can watch to see how it runs, then update it to use the object-per-state strategy.Here's the implementation we did in class, by writing simultaneously into the same code buffer from three different editors. Some things are a bit crazy...However, it shows how a simple state machine deals with state transitions. First, we take care of including the libraries we'll need (strings and input/output). The get_code function is a convenience to make it simpler to prompt the user for a strategem code letter. In this case, we're looking for the code for the 500kg bomb, which is wdsss (). #include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;string&gt;
using namespace std; // purpose: to determine whether the user can type a strategem code correctly. The code will be wdsss (500kg bomb).
// Future work: jump pack: swwsw
// konichiwa string get_code() { string result; cout &lt;&lt; "Enter strategem letter (ONE LETTER, yes, ***ONE***): "; cin &gt;&gt; result; return result;
} Next, we have to define the set of states we can be in at any given time. These are just enum values, meaning that they're just symbolic names for integers. The Init state is zero, and they count up from there. Note, anything that has a one at the end should be read as "W - one" or " D - one", not as a word. The Finished, Error, and Kablooey states are special in that they have a side-effect or they cause the function to return. The rest are just transitional, meant to keep track of where we are in the sequence. A better naming scheme for these probably would have been to follow the letters of the code that have been typed out so far: w, wd, wds, wdss, finished.
enum States { Init, Wone, Done, Sone, Stwo, Sthree, Kablooey, Finished, Error, NumStates
}; We created an array of names for our states so that we can print them out easily.
string state_name(States s) { string names[] = { "Init", "Wone", "Done", "Sone", "Stwo", "Sthree", "Kablooey", "Finished", "Error", "NumStates" }; return names[s];
}
This function was discovered from the body of each state. All of the main states followed the pattern of simply getting a code letter and checking it against what was expected, then switching to the next one or to the error state. This function just makes that into one line.States expecting(string expected, States success, States failure = States::Error) { string code = get_code(); if(code != expected) { return failure; } else { return success; }
}
And we at last arrive at the actual state machine. The things that define this style of state machine are all present:
All of the data is right there in the same function
The entire state machine is encoded as a switch statement in a loop, and all it does is cycle through the states in the order we defined based on input
The states themselves are very simple. They don't have any logic or cleanup for entry and exit, and they don't have any attached data.
void state_machine() { States current_state = States::Init; string last_code = ""; while(current_state != States::Finished) { cout &lt;&lt; "Entering state " &lt;&lt; state_name(current_state) &lt;&lt; endl; switch(current_state) { case States::Init: current_state = expecting("w", States::Done); break; case States::Done: current_state = expecting("d",States::Sone); break; case States::Error: cout &lt;&lt; "Error! That is the wrong code!! YOU DIED! Pls retry, how can you retry if you are dead? YOU CAN'T omgoodness. Dern" &lt;&lt; endl; current_state = States::Finished; break; case States::Sone: current_state = expecting("s", States::Stwo); break; case States::Stwo: current_state = expecting("s", States::Sthree); break; case States::Sthree: current_state = expecting("s", States::Kablooey); break; case States::Kablooey: cout &lt;&lt; "Kaboom" &lt;&lt; endl; return; case States::Finished: cout &lt;&lt; "Mission Over. State machine exiting." &lt;&lt; endl; return; default: cout &lt;&lt; "whoops, I quit." &lt;&lt; endl; return; } }
} int main() { cout &lt;&lt; "Enter strategem code, ONE LETTER AT A TIME!" &lt;&lt; endl; state_machine(); return 0;
}
Now, all we have to do is compile it. To do that, use either clang or g++. Those are both c++ language compilers, which means that they translate your source code into machine code.# Compile the source cpp into an executable called state_machine
&gt; g++ switch_state_machine.cpp -o state_machine
# We can run it like this:
&gt; ./state_machine
# Compile the source cpp into an executable called state_machine
&gt; clang++ switch_state_machine.cpp -o state_machine
# We can run it like this:
&gt; ./state_machine
The state machine switch statement is a useful pattern for very simple machines, but it breaks down when your states start to manage more data. When that happens, we can switch to using a class hierarchy.
// Today: We will write classes to implement the state machine for the jump pack strategem code.
// There are three *kinds* of class we need:
// - A StateMachine
// - A Generic State
// - A bunch of specific states
//
// The StateMachine keeps track of all of the states, and takes the place of the while-loop from our switch statement version.
// The Generic State serves as a way to describe the things that *all* states have to do.
// The specific states each have a small behavior that does the job of the individual parts of our switch statement (updates the behavior according to the state).
// The strategem code is swwsw (Down, Up, Up, Down, Up)
// We can use states like this: S SW SWW SWWS SWWSW
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include&lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; namespace Names { // These are all the states that we have \/ enum StateName{ Init, S, SW, SWW, SWWS, SWWSW, Finished, Error, NumStates, NoChange, };
} /// This is a pure-virtual class, because it can never be instantiated. All it does is describe what **all** actual states must be able to do.
/// We mark things are "pure-virtual" by putting "virtual" before the function and "=0" after them in the declaration.

<a data-href="differential-steering-bot" href="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/engineering-projects/differential-steering-bot.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">differential-steering-bot</a> Today, we're going to start working on a control algorithm to make our bots actually drive along a line. In order to do that, we have to figure out how they can keep track of which way to turn and when to go forward. So, let's analyze the situation. There are four cases we'll start with (and two more that we'll add in a little while...):
The center sensor says it's on the line
The left sensor says it's on the line
The right sensor says it's on the line
None of the sensors detects the line
Note that, if two of the sensors detect the line, then one of them is going to be the center, so we can just treat that as being on the center for now. Since these are all of the possible states for our sensors to be in, and our bot's actions are controlled by the sensors, that means we need to handle these cases!Right away, we need to have a specific action pre-planned to take for each case. Let's go through them one by one:
The center sensor detects the line: If the center sensor detects the line, that means we're headed in the right direction. In that case, we should just drive forward.
The left sensor detects the line: In this case, we're still close to the line, but we're a little off to the right. We should steer left, but still move mostly forward.
The right sensor detects the line: This is just like the left sensor, but with the opposite steering direction
No sensors detect the line: In this case, we need to start searching. The easiest thing to do would be just to pick a direction and spin in place until we find the line again. How about left?
That algorithm should get us line-following! It's that simple. But, I think we can do better. One thing we're not going to handle well at this point is sharp turns. If we only turn gradually when a side-sensor triggers, then a sharp turn will make us lose the line. Then, if the we start spinning in a particular direction, we could end up finding our own back trail instead of the track forward, and we'll go backward along the track! So, what separates that case from the behavior we want? Ideally, we'd spin in place toward where the path leads until we pick it up again. That means we probably want to remember the last sensor readings that actually saw the line. If the path turned sharply left, then we should see a moment when the left sensor was active just before we lose the trail. In that case, we'd want to turn to the left to find it again. The right side would work the same way. This will change the last step of our algorithm, making it into three parts:
No sensors detect the line, and the last side was left: Stop moving forward, spin left until a sensor detects the line.
No sensors detect the line, and the last side was right: Stop moving forward, spin right until a sensor detects the line
No sensors detect the line, and neither side saw it pass by: Stop moving forward, choose a direction and spin until the line reappears. If it doesn't appear after a full revolution, just stop.
This might be a good chance to put your state machine knowledge to work: Our bot has eight states at this point: WaitToStart, Stop, Forward, VeerLeft, VeerRight, SpinLeft, SpinRight, Spin360. You can make a state machine class with state instances for each of those states, and define the transitions you need so that your bot will follow the line.A few of the states probably require some explanation:
WaitToStart: This is just here to give you time to get all of the wires plugged in before your bot starts trying to move. Start in this state, wait for a few seconds, then transition to the next state based on the sensor input
Stop: A state with no exit. This is for when we have lost the line and want the bot to give up and wait for help
Spin360: This is for when we've lost the line and we don't know which side to look on - just spin a full revolution and follow any line you find. It might be backwards, but what can you do?
We want our Robot to be the state machine. It should have all of the states that it needs, and the state instances should just tell which one to change to when necessary. One complication in C++ is that memory is NOT freed up automatically - if you keep calling new, you'll run out. So, let's avoid that.We can name and index our states using an enum:enum StateName { WaitToStart=0, DriveStraight, VeerLeft, VeerRight, SpinLeft, SpinRight, Spin, Stop, NumberOfStates
};
Then, those are just names for increasing integer counting numbers: For example, WaitToStart is 0, VeerLeft is 2, and the rest are numbered according to where they show up in the list. So now we can use them for indexes into an array of State objects:class Robot {
public: State* my_states[NumberOfStates]; StateName current_state; Robot() { this-&gt;setup(); } void setup(){ this-&gt;current_state = StateName::WaitToStart; my_states[WaitToStart] = new WaitToStartState(5000 /*delay*/); my_states[DriveStraight] = new DriveStraightState(0.3 /*speed*/); my_states[VeerLeft] = new VeerLeftState(0.1 /*turn rate*/); my_states[VeerRight] = new VeerRightState(0.1 /*turn rate*/); // ... do the rest of the states } void update() { StateName next_state = this-&gt;my_states[this-&gt;current_state]-&gt;update(this); if(next_state != this-&gt;current_state) { this-&gt;states[this-&gt;current_state]-&gt;leave(); this-&gt;states[next_state]-&gt;enter(); this-&gt;current_state = next_state; } }
But, what are all of those DoSomethingStates? They would be subclasses of a State class that has a simple interface.class State { // I want a function that will update the current state of my bot, and return the name of a new state if a change is needed. virtual StateName update(Robot*) = 0;
} class WaitToStartState: public State {
public: int start_ms; int delay_ms; WaitToStartState(int delay_ms) { this-&gt;delay_ms = delay_ms; this-&gt;start_ms = -1; } StateName update(Robot* _robot) { if(this-&gt;start_ms &lt; 0) { // we haven't initialized it yet! start_ms = millis(); } if(millis() - this-&gt;start_ms &gt;= delay_ms) { return StateName::DriveStraight; } else { return StateName::WaitToStart; } }

We can do this in software or in hardware.The key in either case is that you have to have at least a brief period during which you can compare what it was before to what it is now. That means you need some kind of memory of the value, at least for a brief instant.In code, this is simple. Just make a variable to hold the previous value of your sensor, and compare it to the newly-read value before you update the stored version:bool beam_is_broken = false; void loop() { bool beam_status = digitalRead(BEAM_PIN); if(beam_status != beam_is_broken) { // a change happened! Serial.print("Beam state changed to "); Serial.print(beam_status); Serial.print(", timestamp: "); Serial.println(millis()); } beam_is_broken = beam_status;
}
In hardware, you need some way to compare the old with the new. One such way is with a differential amplifier. A differential amplifier is an op-amp circuit that amplifies the difference between its inputs. By wiring it so that the difference will have a momentary spike when the input signal changes, the op-amp can give you a spike whenever a change happens. <br>Most microcontrollers have a feature called interrupts, which lets you tell the microcontroller to watch a pin and let you know when it changes automatically. In arduino, this is done with the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/cs/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/cs/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/" target="_self">attachInterrupt</a> function:This example will toggle the output LED whenever the input on pin 2 changes (either rising or falling edge).const byte ledPin = 13;
const byte interruptPin = 2;
volatile byte state = LOW; void setup() { pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // INPUT_PULLUP attaches an internal 20k pull-up resistor to the input pin so // that it is HIGH when there is no connection on the attached circuit. pinMode(interruptPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // digitalPinToInterrupt is a helper function to make sure the pin number you // want is actually the right one for an interrupt. Digital pin numbers don't // necessarily match interrupt pin numbers, so you have to use this mapping to // make sure you're actually monitoring the pin you have your wires connected to. attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(interruptPin), blink, CHANGE);
} // Notice that loop doesn't do anything with the interruptPin at all! The arduino
// itself takes care of calling the ISR when an event happens. You can use the ISR
// to change some global data if you want so that loop can be aware of the state
// of things, or you can just do something directly in the ISR. In this case, the ISR
// controls the state variable, which the loop function uses to decide whether to // turn the LED on or off.
void loop() { digitalWrite(ledPin, state);
} // blink is the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for this example. It will be called
// whenever the interrupt gets triggered, which in this case happens whenever the

The sensor readings from three different IR obstacle sensors
The target speed of each wheel
(eventually) Its estimated pose, which means orientation and position
(eventually) The last readings from the IMU
These things taken together represent the state of our robot, and they're going to be called state variables.We will use the encapsulation property of object-oriented design to make the state variables easier to manage. That means we're going to make a single class called Robot that keeps track of all of those variables for itself, using code that's organized and easy to maintain.Without encapsulation, we'd end up with a bunch of global variables and special-case functions to deal with the complexity of this robot. By putting them into a single Robot, we get the big benefit of treating the whole works as a single package. Just knowing where to put things is a big aid in programming - it gives you a chance to make good names for things that are automatically interpreted relative to the class instead of globally to the whole program. It also makes it easy to find the locations of any variables and functions, because it collects them all into a neat package.Eventually, our Robot class will have some cool features: It will have a good idea of where it is at all times
It will be able to drive along a path that involves lines and arcs, without stopping at each turn
It will be able to follow commands like "drive to 200,347" because it has an internal model of the world and knows where it is.
For today, it's enough to wrap the data we're using up with a class and make it drive in a straight line.Today's goals for our bot:
Get all of the wiring connected, including battery packs
Test that it can drive in a straight line (make a program that drives forward for three seconds then quits)
Write a Robot class with member variables for: left wheel target speed
right wheel target speed
left sensor reading
center sensor reading
right sensor reading Add a method called update(int dt_micros) that uses the state varialbes to keep the motors going at the desired speed, and also updates the information from the three sensors.
Add a method called drive_straight(float speed) that drives the bot forward or backward in a line. If the speed is -1.0, it should go backward at full speed. If the speed is 1.0, it should go forward at full speed. Otherwise, it should try to make its speed proportional to the requested value (0 should be stopped! remember how strange servo control is: 90 is the zero position!).
Look back at our original robot code. We wrote a function called map that converted any number in the range into a number in the range . That's how we're going to want to control the motor speed here as well.
<br>We have a few of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://a.co/d/9SgeT5v" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://a.co/d/9SgeT5v" target="_self">these</a> IMU 6050 sensor boards. They make it "easy" to track our orientation and acceleration, which we know from physics means we can use them to estimate our location with some math. They're a little bit complex to use, but if we have time today we'll take a look at what they can do.The basic idea of an IMU is that it contains a device that can sense accelerations in three directions, and rotations around three axes. Some of them also have a three-axis magnetic field sensor that you can use to get an idea of your absolute orientation (basically a compass to read Earth's magnetic field). These don't have that, but we do have a few different boards with that feature.When you use an IMU to keep track of your bot's pose, you end up measuring acceleration and rotation over and over again as quickly as possible. You then use the acceleration data to estimate your velocity change over that time, and then you use the average velocity over that time to estimate your position change. It's an error-prone process, but with a fast enough time step and a good sensor you can do pretty well at keeping track of where you are and which direction you're facing.In order to implement that, we'll need to add several more state variables to our Robot:
long acceleration[3] should hold the most recent three-axis acceleration values
long velocity[3] should hold the current average velocity estimate
long position[3] should hold the current estimate of our position, based on the accelerometer data
long orientation[3] should hold our best estimate of our bot's orientation.
We're used to thinking of the world as having a set coordinate system that's kind-of attached to the ground, and our bot just moves around on it. However, for this it's probably going to be more convenient to imagine our bot is the origin of the coordinate system, and the world is moving around under it. The practical meaning of that is that the acceleration and velocity data are all going to be relative to our bot, not absolute in the world (driving forward will always give us an acceleration in the Y direction, for example, instead of being different depending on which direction the bot is facing).

We're doing final assembly on the line-follower bots today, and I want to get them driving. I suspect we're going to find some issues with the caster wheel on the front (too much steering resistance for the amount of traction we have with the drive wheels), but we will have to try it out to see what happens. We may have another option for the front support, we need to check in our box of goodies.I also want to finally get a good look at the photo gates and start them on the 3D printer. If all is well, it would be good to get them operational before next week.Our main lesson today is going to be understanding the math of differential steering. When our bot makes a turn, what's the turn radius? What's the center of the turn? How the heck do we even figure that out?You already have all of the math you need to be able to answer those questions! At least, as long as you remember your radians...Here are some warmup questions:
How far does a wheel travel as it rolls? Assume you know the diameter of the wheel and the angle of turn.
If two wheels are rolling at different speeds but they're stuck to the same axle, what will happen?
Say you have a really long axle that sticks out far past the wheels on both sides, and you attach it to a post so that the wheels have to travel in a circle. How would you figure out the speed of rotation for each wheel?
Now say that you programmed each wheel to have exactly that speed of rotation, then remove the post. What will happen?
When you get through those answers, you'll have the key to differential steering. Let's explore a bit about how differential steering works. Answer the questions for the robot described below (assume there is never any wheel slippage):
Drive wheel diameter: 10 cm
Distance between drive wheels: 15 cm
Max angular velocity of wheels: 360 per second How far will the robot move if the wheels rotate one revolution forward?
What is the robot's top speed?
If the right wheel is moving at full speed, but the left wheel is stopped, describe the robot's motion.
What is the angular velocity of the robot (not the wheels) in problem 3?
Now say that the right wheel is moving at full speed, but the left is moving at half that speed. Describe the robot's motion.
What is the radius of the turn that the robot is making in problem 5?
What is the angular velocity of the robot in problem 5?

Limitations of the 3D printer We had some issues again with the models, although we've made a LOT of progress! So, what kind of things are still giving us trouble? Just a couple:
We really have to make a full, complete assembly in CAD before we build.
The 3D printer has some limitations that are easy to get into conflict with by accident when we trust the plausible-looking CAD drawings of difficult parts.
Making multi-part assemblies is not an easy job. There are dozens of things that can surprise you by running into each other, being impossible to assemble in real life, or being impossibly thin or oddly-shaped parts. One of the best ways to see these things before you build for real is to build it virtually. Our CAD system makes this really easy - you just import all of your parts, and pretend you're sitting there with them in your hands while you assemble it on the screen.It's still easy to make something that can't be assembled in real life, but if you're careful about what you allow yourself to do, you can catch most of the problems. The good ol' school of hard knocks will teach you the rest as you have to redesign failed parts.After you have the assembly made, you have to actually move all of the moving parts through their ranges of motion to make sure you don't have any unwanted collisions. For example, a caster wheel will fit just fine right next to another part, unless you actually have to turn the caster. At that point, you realize that it sticks out past the center line by a large amount, and your bot won't be able to steer because the caster gets stuck!This is also the best way to make sure of things like overall level of the bot. The rear wheels and the caster are separated by several parts, so it's not trivial to see whether the bot will actually be level when sitting on the ground fully assembled. However, if you actually make the assembly drawing, you can just look and see. If it isn't it's also easy to measure exactly how much to change things in order to get it perfect.Moral: always make a full assembly drawing, and use it to check the fit of everything!3D printers are pretty amazing tech, but they aren't infallible. The have trouble with some common scenarios:
Overhangs
Tall, skinny parts Thin walls
We had several print failures on a caster mount due to a combination of a small overhang and a very thin sidewall. In theory, the printer should be able to do this, but in reality it just can't. So, when that happens, we have to let reality win and adapt our plans. Reality always wins. Every time. So just accept it and redesign!Make notes to yourself about what kinds of things don't work so that you can catch them in the design phase next time, and you'll end up with some very valuable practical knowledge about making things.

Their only purpose is to prove that arranging our electronic parts as a gate will let us do what we're trying to do. But, once we've made the prototype are we done with it?No! We actually have to test it. Testing is an important part of the engineering process, in which you actually check to see if your design meets the requirements you identified earlier. Designing tests is a tricky business, because it's easy to miss the oddball things that happen in real life. The good news is that you can usually do more testing (unless you broke your stuff, which usually means you failed a test anyway...).
How would you test a paper airplane design? What kind of requirements might it have?
How would you check that the prototyp meets them? How can we test our photogate prototypes? Do they detect something passing through?

We're going to run into some complications right away though (big surprise, right!?). The issue is that we want to have a bunch of active sensors sitting very close to each other, and it's very likely that they're going to interfere with each other if they're on at the same time. When light hits a surface in the real world, it scatters in a wide spray. That scattered IR light will most likely travel from the two sensors that see white into the one that's supposed to see black, making it think it's seeing white as well. This is now an engineering problem!The root of the issue here is that we have to share something between a lot of selfish devices. Each one wants to be the only one, but that's not an option. Our job is to figure out how to make them share!There are two main ways we usually do this: space multiplexing and time multiplexing. Space multiplexing is where you arrange things so that they can do their jobs without being so close together that they mess with each other. In communications, they do this with frequency assignments - each channel gets a frequency that's different enough from the others that they don't have cross-talk. In our bot, this would mean either spreading the sensors apart, or making them each require less room. Since spreading them apart isn't going to work because of our needs for detecting a line, how could we make them take less room?
Put shrouds around them - the most obvious answer is to put a shroud around each sensor to try to contain its scattered light and block the light from other ones. This will probably work, but it's a fragile solution. Why? What kinds of things could go wrong?
Use focusing optics - the setup on the sensors right now takes light from a pretty wide angle. If we could put lenses in front of them to focus the light, it would probably reduce the problem quite a bit. However, IR optics are not easy! Glass is not transparent to infrared light!
Turn the brightness and sensitivity down on each sensor, so it's less likely to trigger on indirect light. This might work, depending on how big the problem actually is. It's the easiest to implement, so it's probably worth trying first.
Okay, so our options for space multiplexing so far don't seem great. What about time multiplexing? How does that work? In time multiplexing, you only give control of the space to one thing at a time, and you make them take turns. The idea is that you can make the turns fast enough that you don't risk any errors from having sensors disabled at times. If that's true, then time multiplexing is a good option. How could we do this?
Write a function that only turns one sensor on at a time, and it gives it a very short window for sensing (maybe, 1 millisecond). It then immediately goes to the next sensor to check, and so-on.
You could also try just turning off the middle sensor and keeping the outer sensors lit to see if they are far enough apart to avoid interference. You'd then be switching between middle and outer-two, so instead of three cycles between sensor checks, you'd only have two.
This solution will probably be more reliable than the shrouds. Why is that? Let's get these bots driving around on some lines! It's about time!

The first step is to make sure the senros actually work! So, today we're going to make sure that everything is fully wired together, and then we're going to write code to try to sense the status of our line sensors and tell us what it finds.The bot should end up driving in a circle of about three feet diameter, and it should have two LEDs:
A red LED that stays lit whenever none of the sensors detect the line
A green LED that stays lit whenever any of the sensors detect the line.
We're not worried about following the line yet, just about noticing it.There are two ways we could do this project: Hardware, and software.The hardware approach would put an OR-gate on the output bits of all three of our sensors, and send the result to the green LED. A NOT-gate on the same output would work to control the red one. This would be a great way to solve the problem, but it doesn't let us know whether our code is working properly!The software approach would use a few lines of arduino code to decide when to turn each of the LEDs on based on the data it's getting from the sensors. This is what we're going to do today, although if you're feeling ambitious you could also implement the hardware version in order to have a nice visual debugging tool. Remember that the sensors already have an LED that lights up when they get a reflection though, so we could get the same data by looking to see which sensors are on or off.

If you are using an Arduino, don't worry about this too much as the library takes care of all of this for you. If you are using a different control platform, pay attention. When the outputs are set to High/Low your motor will run. When they are set to Low/High the motor will run in the opposite direction. In both cases, the speed is controlled by the PWM input.Don't forget STBY must be high for the motors to drive.<br><img alt="_resources/tb6612fng-motor-driver-setup/ae4a7c05dc7495d4e5def480593ac97b_MD5.jpeg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/_resources/tb6612fng-motor-driver-setup/ae4a7c05dc7495d4e5def480593ac97b_md5.jpeg" target="_self">For this demo, we'll use a small chassis with the included motors and wheels as well as an Arduino Pro Mini.Our power supply for this is the LiFePo4 battery pack, which outputs either 4.5v at the center tap, or 9v with the full tap.

What happens to it if we "shrink" the hypotenuse a bit?
Growing the hypotenuse makes what was the right angle into an obtuse angle. It also makes the equation into an inequality: .
Shrinking the hypotenuse has the opposite effect: it makes what was the right angle into an acute angle. It also makes the equation into an inequality: .IF there is one side whose square is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then that triangle is obtuse and the obtuse angle is opposite the long side. On the other hand, if ALL sides haves squares that are less than the sume of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is acute. Of course, if one is equal to the sum of the others then the triangle is a right triangle.We should prove this (in class!)

And arcs! Here's where things get interesting.Circles and arcs are obviously important in our world, so it's good to know how to measure them. For circles, there's really only one thing that matters: the radius. From that, you can figure out the circumference, area, and anything else you might want to know. That's because of the definition of a circle:A circle is the locus of all points in the plane that are equidistant from a single point. Later, we'll see a very similar definition for a sphere in 3D.Since the definition just mentions the distance from a point, it stands to reason that the distance would fully define the shape of the circle.What might we want to know about a circle? Two things: it's circumference is the distance you'd travel by following it around the edge until you ended back up where you started. It's the same concept as perimeter for a polygon. If you carefully measure many, many circles, you'll find that there's a simple relationship between the circle's radius and its circumference:But what is ? Well, it's the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter... so, yeah, it's a circular definition hahaha. However, the interesting thing is that is the same for ALL CIRCLES, no matter what the radius is! So, once we actually manage to measure it, we can just remember it and keep using it forever. The value of is approximately . It is an irrational number though, which means that its decimal expansion never repeats and it can't be written as a fraction, no matter how hard you try. That being said, if you want a quick-and-dirty approximation to that's a fraction, you can use , which is correct through the hundredths place.Measuring angles: if you take a circle of radius 1, then is the length of a 180 degree arc. is a 90 arc, and you can find a corresponding fraction of that subtends an arc of any angle you choose. It turns out that it's really convenient to use this kind of measure for angles, because of the fact that is the ratio of two lengths. When you divide a length by a length, you end up with a pure number (it has NO unit!). That means that it doesn't have any effect on physics properties, it just acts as a scaling factor.These fractions of the arc length of a half-circle are called radians. A 180 degree angle is equivalent to radians, and a 360 angle is radians. Any angle can be converted to radians by multiplying by , and an angle in radians can be converted to degress by multiplying by . If is the arc length of a half circle of radius r, then you can see how multiplying the angle in radians by the radius could give you the arc length of any arc. This is very useful for calculations like determining the distance a robot has moved using the change in its wheel angles.To measure the length of an arc that subtends angle , simply find . <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arc%20length" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arc%20length" target="_self">Youtube search for "arc length"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=circumference" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=circumference" target="_self">Youtube search for "circumference"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radian" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radian" target="_self">Youtube search for "radian"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=$c%20=%20%5Cpi%20d%20=%202%20%5Cpi%20r$" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=$c%20=%20%5Cpi%20d%20=%202%20%5Cpi%20r$" target="_self">Youtube search for "<span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span>"</a> What is the radius of a circle with circumference 17?

You know why the bumpkin can't do geometry? It's because everybody knows are round, not calculating the area of a circle calculating the area of a sector of a circle Area of a circle: Remember the area of a polygon: , where and . Think about a circle... What if the circle was really a polygon with thousands of sides? What would it's apothem be? It would be the radius of the circle! What is its perimeter? It's ... so if we just use the formula for the area of a polygon, but fudge things around a bit in a way that seems kinda legit, we do this:That is definitely not a proof, BUT it is nice for the intuition!A sector is a pie-slice of a circle. Let's start from the area of a circle: A circle is just a circular section with an included angle of ... Keep that in mind for the next part.What would the area of a half-circle be? Well, hopefully it would be half of the area, which woud be . And, what would the angle be? Well, it would be . Likewise, the area of a 90-degree sector should be of the area of the whole circle, or , with an included angle of .What can we deduce here? Let's write each of those things out, changing the part out for the included angle:I detect a pattern here... for any included angle of a circular sector, the area is just half the angle in radians times the square of the radius!A chord connects two points on the edge of a circle. What is the area between the chord and the circle? The easiest way to solve this is to find the area of the sector, then subtract the area of the triangle formed by the same points. The triangle will always be isosceles, and you'll be able to find the angle using either the arc length cut by the chord, the length of the chord itself, or the formula for area and circumference of the circular sector.Just like we do with triangles and polygons, we can use the area of the circular sector to assert things about its radius and its circumference. Whenever we have a problem that has related areas, we can immediately say things about the radius of each part! Likewise, we can do the same thing given any of the three properties.Be on the lookout for ways to change problems involving radius, circumference, or area of circles or sectors into problems involving the other pieces. Sometimes this will give you a big simplification!

Use inscribed angles to figure out the other angles in the triangles that you created.
Any time you have secant lines that form an angle, you'll have four points of intersection to work with on the circle. You can add lines between those points to create inscribed angles, and those will give you a lot of information about the other angles in the diagram because of triangles that are created.That's particularly helpful if the secant lines intersect inside the circle.If they intersect outside the circle, the inscribed angles will give you supplementary angles along with triangles. Use them both to compute the angles involved (whether they are angles, or arc angles).General Formula for secant angle that intersects outside of circle:

A line is tangent to a circle when it just touches the circle at one point. A tangent line never goes through the interior of a cirlce, because that would require it to cross into, then back out of the circle, making it a secant line instead.<br><img alt="chap11diag-121.svg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/chap11diag-121.svg" target="_self">

What is a plane? A plane is a flat two-dimensional entity that continues forever. Note: that's not a definition, it's just intuition! We'll get to an actual definition later...This lesson is basically just going to exercise your intuition about planes, so here are some things to think about:
If you have a plane, and a point "floating" above it so that it never touches the plane, how would you measure the distance between them?
If you have a plane, and a line "floating" above it so that it never touches the plane, how would you measure the distance between them? It needs to be a unique number or it has no meaning...
Is it possible to have two planes that have a "distance" between them? If so, how would you measure that?
What happens when two planes intersect each other? What kind of a geometric thing does the intersection make?
Remember the equation of a line: . We have order-one variables, which are summed and add up to a constant. In 2d, this is a sort of definition of "flatness." The plane in 3d is similar:Now we have three linear terms adding to a constant. In 3d, the plane is what we think of as "flat." There are a lot of ways to define a plane, which are useful in different contexts:
The plane is then the set of all points that satisfy the plane equation for a particular assignment of coefficients.
If you have three points that aren't collinear, they always form a triangle. That triangle is part of a plane. The plane can be defined to be the set of all points that make the same plane when you replace any of the first three with the new one.
A plane is the set of all points that you can get by adding linear combinations of two independent vectors to a starting point.
Given a point and a line through the point, a plane is the set of all points that, when used to make another line through the point, make a line that is perpendicular to the starting line. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3-dimensional%20geometry" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3-dimensional%20geometry" target="_self">Youtube search for "3-dimensional geometry"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=parallel%20planes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=parallel%20planes" target="_self">Youtube search for "parallel planes"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=parallel%20lines" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=parallel%20lines" target="_self">Youtube search for "parallel lines"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skew%20lines" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skew%20lines" target="_self">Youtube search for "skew lines"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3-point%20plane" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3-point%20plane" target="_self">Youtube search for "3-point plane"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=intersection%20of%20planes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=intersection%20of%20planes" target="_self">Youtube search for "intersection of planes"</a> Given two points, how many different planes pass through the two points?

Surface area of a prism Volume of a prism Think of a stack of pennies... diagonal: A line drawn through two vertices that are not connected by an edge.
Space diagonal: a diagonal through a prism that does NOT stay within a face.
Face diagonal: A diagonal in a prism that stays within a face.
A prism is a 3-dimensional figure that has:
Two parallel, congruent faces
parallelograms for all other faces
There are a lot of constraints among the faces of a prism that will help you find the dimensions you need (shared edges mostly). Rectangular: Every face of the prism is a rectangle
Right: The bases are perpendicular to the non-base faces.
Regular: the bases are regular polygons
Computing the surface area amounts to computing the area of each face and adding them together. To compute the volume of a prism:
Find the area of one of the parallel faces
Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel faces
Multiply the area by the height.
Think of a prism as a stack of pennies - shifting them around while maintaining their stacked relationship doesn't have any effect on their volume - all that matters is the volume of each penny and the height of the stack. If you make the pennies thinner, it takes more of them but their individual volumes shrink by exactly the same amount, until eventually you get to infinitesimal slices of the prism that are stacked like sheets of paper. Again, you can skew the stack any way you want without changing its volume.

You might think that you could just produce a regular polyhedron with faces of any kind of regular polygon. However, there's a problem! To see what it is, we have to think about angles and corners of a polyhedron.To make a polyhedron, you have to be able to arrange the polygons around a single point that will become a vertex in the final shape. That means that when the polygons have their edges coincident, their end points all connect at the same place. That in turn means that the sum of the interior angles of all of the polygon corners you're using has to be less than 360, otherwise they won't be able to "bend outward" to make a vertex.here's an example of a dodecahedron:<br><img alt="dodecahedron.svg" src="projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/_resources/dodecahedron.svg" target="_self">
If you try to do that with a hexagon, you'll find out that hexagons tile together into a plane! Any any polygon with more than six sides has interior angles are too large to allow the vertices to meet in a single point no matter how you arrange them! So that means... There are only five regular polyhedra! How weird is it that there would be some arbitrary finite number of these things? Sometimes reality is surprising. You'll recognize what they are from D&amp;D:
tetrahedron (4 faces, equilateral triangles, a.k.a d4)
cube (6 faces, squares, a.k.a d6)
octahedron (8 faces, equilateral triangles, a.k.a. d8)
dodecahedron (12 faces, pentagons, a.k.a. d12 -- the best die type)

The axis of a cylinder is the line that connects the center points of the circular ends. Other curved shapes can be the ends of general cylinders, but they will be named specially. A "cylinder" almost always means a right, circular cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder is equal to the area of the bases plus the lateral surface area
The lateral surface area is the area of the portion of the cylinder that "wraps around it". You can find this area by multiplying the circumference of the bases by the height of the cylinder.

Look for a way to slice things up so that the important parts of the problem are all on a single plane, and you'll find an easier solution. Multi-variable equations When you have several equations in several variables, remember to look for ways to substitute a variable out with an expression based on the other variables, in order to get down to a single equation with only one variable. At that point, you can generally solve it and then work backwards to figure out the other variables. Turning geometry problems into algebra sometimes makes things easy. Sometimes the constraints in a geometry problem (the stuff that has to be equal) make really nice, symmetrical equations that are a lot easier to work with than the geometry itself. When you're stumped on a geometry problem, look for a way to do this and it might just get you going again. The areas of three of the faces of a rectangular prism are 24, 32, and 36. Find the volume of the prism. My company produces 6 inch tall cans of paint. The cans have a radius of 15 inches. (Yes, these are very oddly shaped cans!) We want to offer a super-size can of paint. Toby wants to leave the can just as wide as it is, but increase the height by inches. Maryanna thinks the fat cans sell better, so she wants to make them even wider. She wants to increase the radius by inches. After arguing for a while, they decide to go with the design that produces the greatest increase in paint volume. They reach for their scratch paper and figure out how much more paint is needed to fill their new can designs. They both use the same value of , and they find that both designs require the same increase in paint volume! What value of did they use? A ball with radius 6 inches is tangent to the wall and the floor in my house. Given that the wall is perpendicular to floor, what is the radius of the largest ball I can slide into the space between the ball and the corner where the wall meets the floor? <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (geom-gr10) 15.4 Problems (p. 394) (gr10) <a data-href="2025-03-24" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-03-24</a>

Specify a direction and a distance (remind you of anything that starts with a 'v' and sounds like Hector?) Mapping: an operation that turns one thing into another one. Example: You could map point (2,2) into (3,4) by adding (1,2) to it. Anything can be translated (points, figures, etc.)
A translated figure is congruent to the original
With vectors, a translation is done by adding the same vector to all points of the figure.
Anything you can prove about the internal properties of a diagram (i.e. only relating the diagram parts to its own other parts) remains true about all of its translations and rotations. Sometimes it's useful to apply some transformations before you start a proof, mostly just to make things easier for you to see as a human.
Understanding transformations is often more about learning what stays the same rather than what changes. In the three basic transformations we’ll study in this chapter, everything will stay the same for each transformed figure except its location and orientation. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Terminology:%20Translation%20of%20$A$%20is%20$A'$" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Terminology:%20Translation%20of%20$A$%20is%20$A'$" target="_self">Youtube search for "Terminology: Translation of <span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span> is <span class="math math-inline is-loaded"></span>"</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Translation:%20Moving%20something.%20Specify%20a%20direction%20and%20a%20distance%20(remind%20you%20of%20anything%20that%20starts%20with%20a%20'v'%20and%20sounds%20like%20Hector?)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Translation:%20Moving%20something.%20Specify%20a%20direction%20and%20a%20distance%20(remind%20you%20of%20anything%20that%20starts%20with%20a%20'v'%20and%20sounds%20like%20Hector?)" target="_self">Youtube search for "Translation: Moving something.

A rotation of always makes an image that coincides with the original. Rotations can be more than ! Don't forget that when you do your problems! A rotation is a transformation that:
produces an image that is congruent to the original thing being rotated
can change both the orientation and position of the diagram (you can rotate about a point outside of the diagram, and that will make it move)
"spins" the diagram by a specific angle.
Rotations always have a center point and an angle, and in 2D can be either clockwise or counterclockwise. By convention, a positive angle rotation is counterclockwise. This is just an arbitrary choice, but it was made long ago and people stick with it to make it easier to communicate.
After I draw a figure, I rotate it about some point . If the image of this rotation coincides exactly with the original figure, is it true that the image of a rotation of the figure about must also coincide with the figure? Through how many different positive angles less than is it possible to rotate a regular dodecagon clockwise about its center such that its image coincides with the original dodecagon? <br><a href=".?query=tag:hw" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#hw">#hw</a> (geom-gr10) 16.2 Rotations (p. 411) (gr10) <a data-href="2025-03-28" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-03-28</a>

In other words, if we folded our paper along line , and would coincide. If a figure maps to itself under a reflection over a certain line, that line is called a line of symmetry of the figure. For example, every diameter of a circle is part of a line of symmetry of a circle, and each diagonal of a square is part of a line of symmetry of the square. A reflection is a transformation that "flips" a figure over an axis. If you draw the axis, then every part of the figure is transformed to make the axis be the midpoint between the new image and the old.A diagram can be reflected even if the axis goes through it!When the reflection of a diagram concides with the original diagram, then the reflection line is called a line of symmetry. A figure can have many lines of symmetry (or even infinite lines).
What are the fixed points of a reflection over a given line ? In other words, what points are their own images when reflected over line ? Given two different points, and , describe all lines such that the image of upon reflection over is point . How many different lines of symmetry does a regular hexagon have?

Dilation is scaling - you change the size of a diagram, but keep all of the angles and length ratios constant. Dilation has a center and a scale factor. Every part of the diagram is changed: A vector connecting the center to any part of the diagram will be parallel to the vector from the center to the corresponding part of the image
The vector connecting the center to the image will be scaled in length according to the scale factor (scale factor 2 means twice as long as the original, for example)
A negative scale factor means that the vector is pointing antiparallel to the original (opposite direction along the same line). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dilation%20is%20scaling%20-%20you%20change%20the%20size%20of%20a%20diagram,%20but%20keep%20all%20of%20the%20angles%20and%20length%20ratios%20constant." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dilation%20is%20scaling%20-%20you%20change%20the%20size%20of%20a%20diagram,%20but%20keep%20all%20of%20the%20angles%20and%20length%20ratios%20constant." target="_self">Youtube search for "Dilation is scaling - you change the size of a diagram, but keep all of the angles and length ratios constant."</a> <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dilation%20has%20a%20center%20and%20a%20scale%20factor.%20Every%20part%20of%20the%20diagram%20is%20changed%20so%20that%20a%20ray%20drawn%20from%20the%20center%20to%20any%20point%20on%20it%20will%20be%20parallel%20to%20the%20original,%20but%20its%20length%20is%20scaled%20by%20the%20dilation%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dilation%20has%20a%20center%20and%20a%20scale%20factor.%20Every%20part%20of%20the%20diagram%20is%20changed%20so%20that%20a%20ray%20drawn%20from%20the%20center%20to%20any%20point%20on%20it%20will%20be%20parallel%20to%20the%20original,%20but%20its%20length%20is%20scaled%20by%20the%20dilation%20factor." target="_self">Youtube search for "Dilation has a center and a scale factor.

That means that anything in the problem that isn't specified is free to be adjusted, as long as you respect the constraints of what was asked. It really pays off to look at the extremes in a case like that - check for things like, "What if it's zero?" or "What if they're equal?" If those things are allowed in the way the problem is set up, you can usually get some powerful clues about what to do, or even outright solve the problem, without much work at all. Consider the extremes that make things symmetrical, remove parts of the problem entirely, or simplify it in some other way.In geometry in particular, we work with diagrams that can be very complex. Another powerful strategy is to rearrange parts of the diagram into shapes that are easier to work with. Think of an area that's broken into a bunch of pieces, but can be assembled into a square - it's much easier to compute the area of a square than to compute the areas of half a dozen odd-shaped things. If you can rearrange things without changing their sizes and shapes, and you are certain that it doesn't change the answer, then this can really help. The side length of the largest square is 10 inches. The midpoints of the sides of the largest square are connected to form a smaller square. Opposite vertices and the midpoints of opposite sides of the smaller square are then connected as shown. What is the number of square inches in the area of the shaded region?<br>

Each thing that can happen will have both a probability and a value. To figure out the "expected value", you just multiply the value of the thing by its probability, then repeat for all things, and add the result.Think about it starting with a fair coin toss. You win one dollar on heads, and zero dollars on tails. If you flipped the coin 100 times, on average how many winners would you expect? You'd expect 50, because that's the probability of heads (0.5) times the number of trials (100) - in other words, half of the time it works out in your favor. On those tosses, you get $1.00, so the whole deal would be worth $50.00 on average.The expected value asks, "On average, how much is each coin toss worth?" You could take those 50 successes and divide by the total number of coin tosses to figure that out: , or the average value of a toss is $0.50.Exercise: If I earn $2 per heart, $1 per spade, and $-1 otherwise, what is the expected value of drawing a card?

When you design parts, they always have some areas that are tightly interdependent, and between those areas the restrictions are looser. For example, you might be making a panel that has mounting holes for buttons and various circuit boards. Each button or board has a hole pattern that has to be correct, so the holes that are part of the pattern depend on each other in a tight, precise way. However, it doesn't make nearly as much difference where on the panel you put the hole pattern. Your design should mirror that - think of the hole pattern as a stamp, and make the dimensions that define the pattern so that you could easily place the stamp anywhere you want. Once the hole pattern is set up like that, give it a reference point and then use just that point to place the hole pattern onto the larger part. That way you can move it around without breaking the pattern itself.When you place a feature (like a hole pattern), you generally have a concept in your head of where it should go that's based on the overall geometry. Examples would be things like "the axle hole goes through the center of the wheel" or "the centerline of the raised square is on the centerline of the overall widget." Make your constraints so that they tell the drawing how to put itself together in the same way that you think of it.If you put the axle hole so that it's concentric with the wheel, then it will always be in the center where it should be, even if you change the diameter of the wheel. If you instead put the axle hole 2 inches from the edge on a 4 inch wheel, it'll work just fine as long as the wheel size doesn't change, but then if you adjust the wheel your entire design breaks. Think carefully about what's important to the geometry of your parts and try to make your drawing so that it enforces the important stuff.Constraints are like police, you give them the rules and they make sure the rules are followed. If you pick good rules, your part can be pretty easy to work with. If your rules are all mixed together and tangled, and don't actually reflect the true geometry, then your part will be extremely hard to edit.Always think ahead to how you will put the final assembly together. Imagine the steps, including things like how you can actually hold on, where the screwdriver will go, how the wrench might reach the bolt head, and what will happen if you accidentally let go of the spring while it's compressed. It's very easy to design something that's physically impossible to assemble, and sometimes the need to reach a screw will require you to make large, annoying changes to your design. Be at peace with that, because there is no way to avoid it.Nothing is ever perfect. When you are designing parts that need to fit together, think about how you can give them some wiggle room to allow for things like holes that are slightly out of position or a little bigger or smaller than they should be, or surfaces that aren't perfectly flat. Doing this is called "tolerancing," and it is absolutely vital to making good parts. There are lots of tricks people have developed:
widen through-holes for bolted together pieces
make some features as slots instead of exact mates, so that parts can slide a bit past each other
allow for shims or spacer screws to make fine adjustments
Always think of everything you draw as having a range of sizes, and make sure that your part will work as long as the design is anywhere in that range.
Each project will be given as a specification, and in order to meet requirements it must be 3D printed or CNC machined and come out within tolerance.Create a wheel that is 2 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick, and has a four-hole bolt pattern to attach it to a hub. The bolts should be 1/2 inch from the center, and will be #6 flat-head machine screws. The visual design of the wheel is up to you!Create a wheel that visually matches the drive wheel, but is designed to have a 1/4" ID ball bearing installed. The wheel must allow the bearing to be securely installed both within the wheel and onto a threaded shaft. This will become the steered wheel assembly for a car.Create a hub that attaches to the wheel with four #6 flat-head machine screws. The hub should have a hexagonal hole for a #6 nut to fit into for each screw in order to make assembly easier. The hub will be attached to a drive shaft that is 0.0625" diameter. It should have a hole for a #8 set-screw to be installed that will bind the hub to the drive shaft. The collar that attaches to the drive shaft must be strong enough to support the impacts of a robot moving over uneven terrain!
