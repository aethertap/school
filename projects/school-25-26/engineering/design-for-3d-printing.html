past years, I have gotten deeper and deeper into 3d-printing. One thing that fascinates me a lot is how different it is from other manufacturing methods. And how this, in turn, means a completely different design philosophy is needed to create good designs for 3d-printing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As such, I have been collecting the little tricks and rules for designing well-printable parts. And of course I am always on the hunt for more. In this blog post I want to share all that I have learned.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/1a5a4e8d0d8be25ff6e1e3fdf523188b_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="Introduction" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Introduction_0">Introduction</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While a lot can be found online about the basics of design for 3d-printing, there is not that much material that dives into it in-depth. And even less common are good overviews that collect all the little tricks that people have discovered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I believe the best format for teaching the rules of well-printable design is a format that is built on rules of thumb and many practical examples. While such heuristic rules will never encompass the whole complexity of the real world, I think they can provide a tangible guide towards the best solution in each situation. They also provide a starting point for building your own intuition about the topic.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This approach is close in spirit to the german book <em>Konstruktionspraxis im Maschinenbau</em> by Gerhard Hoenow and Thomas Meißner (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.hanser-kundencenter.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446464858" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.hanser-kundencenter.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446464858" target="_self">Hanser Fachbuch</a>, ISBN 978-3-446-46485-8). The book follows the same philosophy, but for traditional manufacturing methods. If you like this style, that book might interest you as well.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Scope" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Scope_0">Scope</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before diving in, a few words about the scope of this blog post: First, I am explicitly focusing on FDM/FFF printing (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>). A lot of the rules are specifically tied to the restrictions of this process and do not apply to other additive manufacturing methods.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Second, I am focusing on designing functional parts with optimal mechanical properties. These parts should be easy to print, without requiring much printer fine-tuning. They should be easy to produce in higher quantity, which means they should require as little post-processing and waste as little material as possible. Aesthetics do not play a primary role, although I firmly believe that great mechanical design just looks incredibly beautiful :)</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Goals of Design Engineering" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Goals_of_Design_Engineering_0">Goals of Design Engineering</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Any mechanical design ultimately must be optimized for a large number of objectives and constraints. Your job as the designer is to create a part that fits best between them all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The most universal objectives are:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><strong>Design according to force</strong> — Parts should be designed such that their geometry is optimal for the forces it has to transmit and withstand.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><strong>Design according to manufacturing method</strong> — Often called <em>DFM</em> (Design For Manufacturing), parts should be designed such that they are easy to produce. Little changes, which usually don't affect functionality, can often make a part <em>much</em> simpler to manufacture.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><strong>Design according to cost</strong> — Parts should be as cheap as possible. With 3d-printing, this means minimizing material use and print time.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Of course, any real world project will have many more objectives and a lot of other constraints that the design must comply with.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this blog post, I will focus on topics related to design for manufacturing with a 3d-printer. In general, the rules for other objectives are the same, regardless of manufacturing process. However, there are some places where 3d-printing does influence these other objectives and I will also highlight such cases.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An important distinction that I need to make at this point is how the approach of design engineering attacks the problem from the completely opposite side compared to, for example, slicer developers and 3d-printer manufacturers. While they aim for improving the manufacturing process itself, to better print any possible part geometry, a design engineer instead aims for adapting the part geometry to best work with the current state of the the manufacturing processes.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To give an example, a design engineer aims to use the most coarse tolerance on each dimension that still allows the part to function. A 3d-printer manufacturer wants their machine to print with the most tight tolerance they can achieve. While the design engineer could try making use of this most tight tolerance, this will make the part impossible to manufacture using cheaper printers and thus drive up cost and limit possible suppliers for a part.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This can be summarized as aiming for <em>portable design</em>. A portably designed part can be printed by anyone on any printer with ease. If you intend to share your designs online, this should definitely be a priority.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Finally, it is also important to keep in mind that due to the rapid innovation in the 3d-printing scene, we are working with a moving target. As the 3d-printers and slicer software get improved, some of the design rules will become less important.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Terminology" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Terminology_0">Terminology</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To make sure everyone is on the same page, let's quickly review the most important terminology of FFF 3d-printing that will be used in the following chapters:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><strong>Layers</strong> — The horizontal cross-sections of a part that are stacked on top of one another to create the part (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#layer-height" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#layer-height" target="_self">Layer height — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><strong>Perimeters</strong> — On each layer, the 3d-printer will first print the outline of the cross-section. This outline consists of a number of perimeter lines (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#perimeters" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#perimeters" target="_self">Perimeters — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><strong>Shell</strong> — If you think of only the perimeters on each layer, you get a completely hollow object: The <em>shell</em> of the part.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><strong>Infill</strong> — Inside the perimeters, the 3d-printer "fills" the space using a partially hollow pattern. This is the infill pattern (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" target="_self">Infill — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><strong>Infill Percentage</strong> — How much of the infill pattern is solid vs. empty space (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42" target="_self">Infill — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto"><strong>Overhang</strong> — When the cross-section of a layer gets larger than the previous layer, a part of the perimeter lines will not be supported by material from below. This is called an <em>overhang</em> and is actually possible as long as the overhang is not too large. Mostly, people talk about the angle of an overhang when looking at the layers from the side.</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto"><strong>Bridges</strong> — While overhangs can become problematic, one thing 3d-printers are surprisingly good at is bridging gaps between two supporting surfaces. This is called a <em>bridge</em>.</li>
<li data-line="7" dir="auto"><strong>Seam</strong> — The <em>seam</em> is the point where the printer starts and stops laying a perimeter. This point is usually well visible as a perfectly smooth transition is very hard to achieve (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069" target="_self">Seam position — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>)</li>

To achieve the aforementioned <em>portable designs</em>, it is useful to define a design target for your work. Namely a rough outline of the 3d-printer and profile that the design will be printed with.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While most of the following rules are relevant regardless, I will need to make some assumptions. Especially for all the numbers I will mention, a design target is needed for context. Otherwise values for expectable tolerances and empirical dimensional recommendations will have no meaning.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As such, here is my definition of the <em>standard printer profile</em>. Cutting across the current market of 3d-printers, the vast majority are compatible with the following expectations. A lot of the expectations are intentionally kept quite vague — we must not assume too much, to keep the designs <em>portable</em>.</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">The standard 3d-printer is using an 0.4&nbsp;mm nozzle.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">The standard profile prints at 0.2&nbsp;mm layer height.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">The standard 3d-printer is calibrated such that no considerable dimensional deviation is caused by error in the steps/mm setting. Skew between the axes is negligible.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">Print speeds are tuned to an adequate level but we cannot assume the printer to be free of artifacts like slight overshoot and ringing.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">Bridging across reasonable distances is reliable.</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto">Overhangs print fine.</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto">Bed adhesion is adequate and does not pose an issue for non-extreme geometry.</li>

</ol></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="1. Designing for Part Strength" dir="auto" class="heading" id="1._Designing_for_Part_Strength_0">1. Designing for Part Strength</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first rules I will present are related to designing parts that are as strong as possible. In 3d-printing, the strength of a part is inherently tied to the manufacturing process. For one, the parts are partly hollow and thus behave quite differently than a solid block of plastic. Second, the layered manufacturing process leads to anisotropic parts — meaning their mechanical properties differ depending on direction (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy#Materials_science_and_engineering" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy#Materials_science_and_engineering" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thus, beyond general design rules for part strength, a few additional considerations should be made when designing parts for 3d-printing.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Part Orientation" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Part_Orientation_0">Part Orientation</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Let's start with the most obvious: 3d-printed parts are much weaker in the direction of pulling apart the layers. Thus, before starting on a design, you should first consider the direction of tensile forces in your part and use them to decide on a print orientation. All further design should then be done with this print orientation in mind.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is probably the number one rule that everyone talks about in design for 3d-printing. And that is for good reason because the difference it makes is substantial. Tests performed by My Tech Fun indicate roughly 3 times more strength in ideal orientation (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiQek0wei1g" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiQek0wei1g" target="_self">YouTube</a>). While the exact ratio will depend heavily on the individual part, I think this is a good indicator of how important this topic is.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0fccc1f827b4ebe52539d0ed299c0378_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A threaded part designed for upright printing (not ideal for tensile loading) and one designed for printing flat on the bed. By cutting away a part of the thread, it can be printed lying flat on the print bed, without supports.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">You should also keep in mind that tensile forces are exerted to some cross section of a part when bending it. This means that you should also align any bending moments parallel to the print surface. A place where this often fails is printed clips, which bend slightly to clip into their counterpart. Such features will break easily when not oriented correctly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bceb4db1877657e9fb0df1565615ad16_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Clips like the one on the left do not survive many uses before breaking.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I also want to give a small tip here about sharing your designs on platforms like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/" target="_self">Printables</a>: Make sure you upload your models in the correct print orientation.

While it is often fine to make a trade-off and accept limited strength in certain locations, one alternative should always be kept in mind:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As each piece gets printed individually, you are completely free to choose the optimal orientation for each one. Clever joints can be used to easily assemble the whole part afterwards. Just to mention one: Dovetail joints have proven themselves for 3d-printing, as they are well-printable in most orientations.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/bdbf1c230dc678b36700e03ae1f794b6_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A dovetail joint is used to attach two halves of a part so that each piece can be printed in an improved orientation.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="To infill or not to infill" dir="auto" class="heading" id="To_infill_or_not_to_infill_0">To infill or not to infill</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Contrary to the first rule, a topic that is not talked about enough in my eyes is the role of infill in part strength. There is a big misconception that you can magically give your part ultimate strength by just using 100% infill. While you will certainly see an increase in strength, this method is not efficient at all — most of the additional material does not contribute to part strength and is just waste and an unnecessary increase of print time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Why? It all has to do with the distribution of force inside of a part. Generally, most parts are not stressed in pure tension or compression. Instead, a lot of stress is applied in the form of bending moments and those distribute the force unevenly. The force will be greatest in places furthest away from the center (neutral axis). Thus, it is generally more effective for additional material to be added at the surface, not the center of a part.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9094e6b8b3303d452d6fd4720ba23dfa_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Stress is highest directly beneath the surface of the part. Notice the blue neutral axis in the middle, where stress is lowest.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In 3d-printer speak, this means you should increase the number of perimeters/shells rather than the infill percentage. Stefan from CNC Kitchen has done a thorough analysis of this (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmEaNAwFSfI" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmEaNAwFSfI" target="_self">YouTube</a>).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In general, his work is a great resource for in-depth information about the mechanical behavior of 3d-printed parts (CNC Kitchen <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cnckitchen.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/" target="_self">Blog/Website</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen" target="_self">YouTube</a>).</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="The Flow of Forces" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Flow_of_Forces_0">The Flow of Forces</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, there is more to this. We can actually influence the amount of stress at the surface by changing the shape of the part. This is often much more effective than optimizing print settings. A way to conceptualize the stress inside of a part is to think about the forces "flowing" through it. The visual representation of this is called a <em>force lines drawing</em> (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_lines" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_lines" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/d5948965a77724e8944c840b2690bcb5_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Force lines in a plate with a central crack under tension.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kokcharov, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" target="_self">CC BY 3.0</a>, via <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CrackForceLines.png" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CrackForceLines.png" target="_self">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Stress will concentrate in places where the force lines are close together.

They impact part strength very negatively and are usually easy to avoid by simply adding a fillet. You can see how a fillet allows a much more direct path for the force than a sharp corner:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_MD5.svg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_md5.svg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_MD5.svg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4b1e0150433e84c9e80f8a1e58781f92_md5.svg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Force lines around a sharp corner vs. a corner with a fillet.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Cross-sectional Considerations" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Cross-sectional_Considerations_0">Cross-sectional Considerations</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printed parts with their shell and infill has yet more implications for part strength that are worth talking about. In traditional design engineering, you are taught to reduce cross-sectional area of a part as much as possible. You should only keep material in places where it has the highest effect on increasing part strength. The reason for this is that reduced volume directly leads to reduced material usage and thus cost and weight savings.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With 3d-printing, things work differently. You can usually increase the cross-sectional area quite a bit, without a noticeable increase in material usage, as the infill is mostly empty space. You should rather strive to reduce the surface area of a part, because that is where most material is used.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This means that you can get away with much thicker shapes in 3d-printed parts, which obviously benefits part strength a lot. Don't try to work against this artificially — if a design allows for it, go for the fattest shape possible.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To give an example, think about the traditional I-beam (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>) cross-section. The idea is that material is only kept in the regions far away from the neutral axis of the bending moment, where it has the highest impact on part strength. This allows for significant weight savings.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While the I-beam profile works wonders for homogeneous materials, it is not a good idea for 3d-printing. A square cross-section of the same outer dimensions will have comparable or better strength but usually does not lead to an increase in material usage and print-time. It might actually perform better in those areas, as shown below.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/caf92a37ac92d970c9a7b893b097ee66_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Comparison of print times and material usage for I-beam profile and square profile.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Simulation Struggles" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Simulation_Struggles_0">Simulation Struggles</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In traditional mechanical engineering, whenever a part needs to be evaluated for its strength, the tool of choice is simulation. Simulation allows making accurate prediction of a part's behavior under load without needing to manufacture it. Especially for parts made from expensive materials or made using expensive manufacturing methods, performing simulations beforehand is critical for the project's budget.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Unfortunately, simulation quickly breaks down when trying to analyze 3d-printed parts. The problem is, once again, the inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printing. While stress analysis may still be useful to find critical areas to give attention to, extracting realistic values for limiting forces is a lost cause.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luckily, there is an alternative to simulations that 3d-printing offers. The exceptionally low cost of manufacturing 3d-printed parts means that printing prototypes for testing mechanical properties is often the most cost-effective solution. Need to find yield strength of a design? Just print a few copies and empirically determine it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, there is one things to be careful with: While I see test-prints as a great way to determine mechanical properties, I advise to not rely on them for determining dimensional accuracy. I will go into more detail on my reasons for this in the next chapter.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Finally, an implication of the above is that <em>topology optimization</em> (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>) is not really well suited for FFF 3d-printing. While it is amazing for other additive manufacturing processes, current tools are usually not able to produce designs that would truly be optimal for FFF 3d-printing. Not to speak of the often less-than-ideal printability of such parts.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="2.

Manufacturing Tolerance and Part Finish</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Next, I want to talk about optimizing your design to improve manufacturing tolerances. Certain shapes will generally print cleaner than others. If you take this into consideration during design, you can achieve parts that fit on first print and won't need endless tweaking of the slicer settings and printer. A welcome side-effect of improved tolerance is a cleaner part finish as well. Thus, the following chapter covers both: Manufacturing tolerance and part finish.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Chamfers vs. Fillets" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Chamfers_vs._Fillets_0">Chamfers vs. Fillets</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To start, let's talk about edges. Generally, mechanical parts should avoid sharp edges because they are unpleasant to touch. Any good design breaks edges by either adding a round fillet or a 45° chamfer of appropriate size.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While the choice between the two is often made for stylistic reasons, there are actually some rather important printability aspects to it. There are two situations that we have to look at, distinguished by the print orientation of the edge:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adding a fillet or chamfer to edges <em>parallel</em> to the print surface means the feature will be built up from multiple layers, potentially with overhang. Fillets are not well suited for this. They start with an incredibly steep overhang that will not print well. Often, such fillets will have large surface deviations. Even if no overhang is involved, when the fillet sits on top, the changing curvature will make the layer steps very visible, degrading the part finish. Chamfers are much better suited in this orientation. They have a constant overhang angle, leading to a very consistent layer stepping, which looks a lot more pleasing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/9380459d1ac26750bbbdb16d818e6610_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fillets and chamfers on edges parallel to the print surface. The blue perimeter on the bottom of the fillet marks an unsupported overhang.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Contrary, edges <em>vertical</em> to the print surface are much better suited for fillets. A fillet means that the printer does not have to make sharp corners while laying the perimeters. This reduces print-head acceleration and thus reduces surface artifacts (ringing, overshoot). A chamfer on such edges will have two sharp corners, which will never look as pretty and will never achieve the same tolerances as a round fillet.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fillets and chamfers on edges vertical to the print surface. The print speed significantly decreases for the chamfer corners while the fillets can almost keep the same velocity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Thus, unless stylistic choices dictate something else, the cleanest prints will be achieved by following this rule:</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Horizontal Holes" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Horizontal_Holes_0">Horizontal Holes</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With horizontal fillets, a major problem is the steep overhang. There are other design features where similar problems arise. For example, horizontally oriented circular holes. The larger they get, the bigger the problem will be. The solution is to deviate from the perfect circle for a more optimized shape. For smaller holes, a teardrop shape with a 90° angle works well. Larger holes can be extended to have a flat "roof". Keep in mind that a slight amount of additional clearance will be needed beneath the roof, due to the bridges drooping slightly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/00dbaf008fe37db77505d13771aabba4_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">On the left: A ⌀4&nbsp;mm hole with a 90° teardrop.

Perimeter seams are the point where a perimeter line starts and ends. It is very hard to tune a printer such that there won't be any seam artifacts. Thus, let's put thought into the placement of this seam so it does not interfere with any functionality or aesthetics.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Usually, the seam placement is chosen automatically by the slicer. For each layer, it searches for the sharpest corner (concave or convex) and then places the seam right into it. This has proven to be a very reliable way to produce good results without requiring any explicit user input.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, this algorithm breaks down in two situations:</p></div><div class="el-ol"><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">On perfectly round perimeters, like those of a circular hole or outline.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">When all corners have the same angle or when the sharpest corner requires tight tolerances.</li>
</ol></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Especially the first case is very relevant. This effect has severe consequences for the tolerances you can achieve with a circular hole. While the rest of the perimeter may deviate by less than 0.1&nbsp;mm, the seam artifacts can easily bump that up to 0.4&nbsp;mm. And worse, it shifts the centerline of the hole because the seam is only in one place.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The solution is simple: Add a corner where the seam can be placed without interfering. Instead of a perfect circle, shape the hole like a teardrop where the corner has a 120° angle. Note the difference to the horizontal holes discussed previously.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/27d1a9ae50dea73064151e31c38f4bcf_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This teardrop shape allows the seam to not interfere with the circular hole (white dots/line indicates seam placement).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Similarly, if other corners must not be used for seam placement, add a small notch somewhere that will serve as the "sharpest corner" and thus take the seam automatically. While you can of course also manually place the seam using the slicer software, this trick means no slicer tweaking is needed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/f5f20f45f39051d72299566e68474ef2_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Difference of forcing the seam placement. On the left, the seam destroys the appearance of the groove in the center.

As stated in the beginning, the goal is to build <em>portable</em> designs, so we should assume conservative limits instead of exhausting the capabilities of a particular printer. Note that this is backwards to the traditional workflow: Instead of <em>specifying</em> tolerances that someone else then has to achieve during manufacturing, you <em>accept</em> certain tolerances of the manufacturing process and design accordingly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It also needs to be noted that a base assumption here is that the 3d-printers in question are well-calibrated. A machine that is out of calibration will have an additional constant error on top of its tolerances. For example, badly configured <em>steps/mm</em> values will lead to a constant factor deviation of measurements along a certain axis. Part design cannot and should not accommodate for this — there wouldn't be much left if we tried.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/94d099f242ae969dc2d929af0c24b070_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A miscalibrated printer will have a constant error on top of its general manufacturing tolerances.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before we can talk about tolerance values, it is important to understand what causes these deviations in the first place. A tolerance value means nothing without the context that it applies to. In 3d-printing especially, tolerances will vary widely depending on specific part geometry. This topic is quite far-reaching, as a very large number of factors play into it. As such, this chapter will only contain the most important things to consider.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Starting from the bottom, the lower bound on accuracy is due to the <em>step resolution</em> of the printer's stepper motors and their drivers. Fundamentally, there is no way to get more accurate than this, as dimensions will always fall somewhere between two step locations. However, on state-of-the-art 3d-printers, the theoretical step resolution is around 0.01&nbsp;mm. Whether this value is actually achievable is debatable, but the takeaway is that step resolution is well below the deviations caused by other effects.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Continuing on, there are more effects of the printer's motion system on dimensional accuracy. They all have to do with mechanical unrigidness of the printer. Tuning the slicer settings and advanced motion control (input shaping) can bring large improvements here. However, an equally big role is played by the geometry the print-head is printing. Sharp corners are the worst offender as they force the printer to maximum acceleration. By optimizing a part for "easy motion", tolerances of printed parts can often be improved a lot.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/3a438e2e90ac58e7fecde5f7507206cb_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Once again, fillets and chamfers show quite spectacularly how different the print-head acceleration will be in different scenarios. Sharper corners lead to higher acceleration and will thus have worse tolerance.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The next anti-accuracy component of a 3d-printer is the extruder and hotend. Uneven extrusion makes the line width vary, which has an impact on the outer dimensions of a part. Additionally, the nozzle of the printer always slightly drags the extruded line behind it. This leads to circles always being slightly undersized. On inner circles (vertical holes), assume deviation to make the hole smaller. On outer circles, assume deviation to make the outer diameter smaller, but to a lesser degree.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As a rule of thumb, for current popular FFF 3d-printers with an 0.4&nbsp;mm nozzle at 0.2&nbsp;mm layer height, these effects lead to deviations in the range of ±0.1&nbsp;mm for each surface. The deviations are shifted for circular paths, as mentioned. While many surfaces will be more accurate, this value is a safe bet for surface deviation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Unfortunately, while 3d-printers usually do not have a noteworthy growth in tolerance for larger dimensions, other effects take over here: Especially warping and shrinkage of the 3d-printed parts as they cool down.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Warping and shrinkage depend heavily on the choice of material, but there are also part geometries that experience it more than others. In general, the more voluminous a part is and the less sharp its edges are, the less warping can be expected. Think about the forces exerted when the material shrinks and how the geometry can resist those forces.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Perfect Precision" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Perfect_Precision_0">Perfect Precision</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The previous chapter discussed what tolerances can be expected from the FFF 3d-printing process. However, there are of course situations where more accuracy is required. One approach that is often used to deal with this is experimentally determining a CAD dimension where the final part fits perfectly. 3d-printing makes this very easy because test prints are cheap and fast. Often, 3d-printers have surprisingly good repeatability so a dimension that was optimized using test prints can achieve quite incredible tolerances. Some call this the <em>goldilocks approach</em> (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/finding-perfect-part-fits-with-the-goldilocks-approach-and-openscad/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/finding-perfect-part-fits-with-the-goldilocks-approach-and-openscad/" target="_self">Hackaday</a>).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, this empirical approach has a huge drawback: It makes your design depend heavily on the slicer settings that were used and the specific printer that the part was printed on. As discussed in the beginning, the goal is to avoid such dependence as it makes the design less <em>portable</em>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Luckily, there are other approaches that you can use to achieve the same goal, but without requiring tight tolerances. Of course, these approaches also have their limitations. So what is best in a given situation needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first approach I want to discuss here is ingeniously simple. It is best summarized like this (and I wish I had a proper source for this quote):</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The idea is that in places where accuracy is needed, you should design your part such that the dimension can be adjusted. There is a huge variety of adjustment mechanisms to choose from. The following four examples should serve to demonstrate the possibilities:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Oblong holes for screws</strong> allow sliding a part into alignment.

The goal is to reduce part count. This speeds up assembly and thus often leads to decreased manufacturing cost.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A ubiquitous example of functional integration are clips in injection molded plastic parts. They replace the additional joining element that would be required otherwise. For this reason, they play a large role in making products cheaper and easier to manufacture. Clips will be discussed in more detail later.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">3d-printing is suited especially well for functional integration, because additional geometric complexity does not really impact manufacturing cost. This is in contrast to, for example, subtractive machining, where additional geometric features generally drive up the cost. So striving for maximum functional integration is usually a good idea with 3d-printing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, there are some nuances to this. Printing everything in a single part limits the print orientation for some features. This can negatively affect strength, tolerances, and geometric freedom. Additionally, a highly integrated part is more difficult to prototype because each iteration requires reprinting a large model. And later in the life cycle, repair of a broken part also requires replacement of a bigger component than what would have been necessary with a design of many smaller parts that are joined together. More than once, I have explicitly kept certain functions in separated parts to facilitate easier prototyping or repair.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Nevertheless, the following chapters will demonstrate some design ideas that allow integration of certain features.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Zip tie Channels" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Zip_tie_Channels_0">Zip tie Channels</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first idea that I will demonstrate is a rather simple trick.

Flexures are design features that explicitly use elasticity of a part to integrate certain freedoms of movement (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Overall, 3d-printing is perfect for designs that incorporate flexures. The thin features required by flexures are easy to print, while complex to create with other manufacturing methods.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Two types of flexures that are very common will be discussed in more detail below: Clips and so-called "living hinges". But first, a few general points about flexures in 3d-printing are presented.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The amount of movement allowed by a flexure is mostly limited by how much deflection is possible without plastic deformation. A thicker flexure will start plastically deforming much earlier. Thus, it is very important to keep flexures as thin as possible when large movements are intended. Force can be increased by stacking multiple thin flexures, rather than creating a single thick one. Alternatively, the travel distance of a thicker flexure can be increased by increasing its length — maybe even in a snaking pattern.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/fba5233810127bdb2642aff6a8d2b048_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The hooks on this cable comb are made from two parallel flexures. This is more stiff than a single flexure, but has the same travel in the elastic region.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To make flexures long-lived, it is important to ensure they cannot be moved too far. Features should be strategically placed as end-stops to a flexures movement. This way, the movement is always kept in the elastic region and the flexure will live much longer.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another use for flexures is sidestepping tolerance issues. This only works when no significant force is exerted on the joint, but can be a nice tool to cheaply solve accuracy issues.

For the same reason, clips are popular for 3d-printed designs — avoiding additional fastening hardware is often desirable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">However, care must exercised with design of clips. The travel distance of the clip, retention force, and feature size must be carefully balanced. Another significant factor is the orientation of the clip relative to the print surface. Especially clips built across layers are very fragile. In many cases it is better to keep travel minimal and instead work with a larger clip force for retention.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For clips that retain by form-locking the other part geometrically, it is a great idea to include a way to undo the clip. Usually, this can be achieved by providing space to reach the clip with a tool like a screw-driver to push it backwards.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Living Hinges" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Living_Hinges_0">Living Hinges</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One more type of flexure that has exploded in popularity as part of optimizing for mass-production are "living hinges". These are hinges which move by plastic deformation rather than disjoint parts rotating on an axis. Any cheap plastic container with a lid probably uses one or two of these hinges, because they are so much more cost-effective and simple than proper hinged joints.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We can also make use of living hinges in 3d-printed design, but there are a few limitations: The hinge absolutely needs to to lie flat on the print bed to achieve the thin sheet of plastic that reliably deforms.

These then have to be broken with force after printing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another critical topic for print-in-place design is the necessary clearance between interfacing parts. Printing multiple surfaces very close to each other can be difficult for some printers.

Beyond plastic - Machine Elements</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After discussing the peculiarities of 3d-printed parts for so long, it is time to widen the horizon. Most functional designs will not be entirely 3d-printed, but also include other components. The largest number of them are most likely going to be <em>machine elements</em>. Screws, nuts, bearings, and all the other standard parts optimized for certain functions. In the following chapter, design considerations related to the use of such machine elements will be evaluated.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Nuts and bolts" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Nuts_and_bolts_0">Nuts and bolts</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Arguably the most ubiquitous machine elements are screws. For the most part, they are used to fasten different components to each other. While it is easy to just pick the next best screw and design your parts around it, there is more to it if the joint is meant to last. In traditional mechanical design, selection of screws can be a science of itself. Especially, when the screw is heavily loaded or safety critical. With design for 3d-printing, it is technically no different — but fortunately, you can usually get away with ignoring a lot of the complexity involved. Nonetheless, I think it is important to at least know the limits and some general guidance on what is good or bad for a screwed connection of 3d-printed parts.</p></div><div class="el-h6"><h6 data-heading="Screw Preload" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Screw_Preload_0">Screw Preload</h6></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In screw theory, one of the most important values is the preload force (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint#Theory" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint#Theory" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>). That's the clamping force exerted by the screw at rest after tightening. For a screwed joint to work, the preload force must be greater than any forces experienced by the joint during operation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/51c0431802127b73bbca7783d5122ad6_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A bolted or screwed joint can be modelled using springs. Preload compresses the parts and elongates the screw. As long as the external load never becomes greater than the preload, the joint is fixed in place.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg" target="_self">Stephen Mckelvey</a>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In metal to metal joints, this preload is achieved by elongation of the screw. In 3d-printing and other thermoplastics applications, the joint members are much less stiff than the screw, leading to the preload mostly coming from compression of the plastic parts instead. The implication is that any of the traditional preload calculation methods are mostly useless here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Attempting to reach the required preload force, one quickly reaches the yield strength limit of the printed parts, leading to deformation or worse. While the achievable preload is usually enough to deal with static loads of an application, it is often not possible to counteract the dynamic loads. Vibrations or shocks are usually the worst offenders.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The solution is one that's also often used for additional security of metal joints as well: Use additional screw locking measures, like lock-nuts or a threadlocking adhesive.</p></div><div class="el-h6"><h6 data-heading="Screw Length" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Screw_Length_0">Screw Length</h6></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another noteworthy parameter of screwed joints is the length of the screw, or more precisely the length of the compressed section of the 3d-printed parts. As a rule of thumb, you should design the joint such that the screw is as long as possible.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There are two effects at play that make this a reasonable choice:</p></div><div class="el-ol"><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">A long screw ensures the part is preloaded entirely in compression rather than tension. When an external load is then applied, it counteracts the compression. With a short screw, the external load would just add more tension which printed parts often cannot take well anyway.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">A longer screw has to be tightened with more turns to compress the part past its yield strength. This means it becomes less likely to accidentally overtighten the joint.</li>
</ol></div><div class="el-h6"><h6 data-heading="Threads in Printed Parts" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Threads_in_Printed_Parts_0">Threads in Printed Parts</h6></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With screws and thermoplastics, an important consideration is the thread for the screw to fasten to. In metal applications, the thread is often simply cut into the mating part. With 3d-printed parts, the same is possible, but threads made from thermoplastics are a lot weaker. This means the threads can be easily stripped by overtightening the screw.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Nonetheless, plastic threads are an option. They can be tapped into a part if an adequately sized hole is printed and wall thickness is high enough. For bigger diameter threads (M8 and up), modelling the threads in CAD and printing them is an option, although quality of such threads is not always good. The strength of thermoplastic threads is surprisingly good — however they do not like repeated assembly and the aforementioned overtightening problem should not be underestimated.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0e9101f0c8d18170ff34c8f15f14c625_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Tapping a thread into a printed part.</p></div><div class="el-h6"><h6 data-heading="Rib Thread Forming" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Rib_Thread_Forming_0">Rib Thread Forming</h6></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">An alternative to thread tapping is to combine the previously discussed concept of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs" target="_self">Crush Ribs</a> with a standard threaded screw.

This produces parts with unique flexibility, especially interesting for wearable applications. For this reason, 3d-printing onto fabric is quite popular in the cosplay scene.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The gist is that a print consisting of many individual pieces is paused roughly 2 to 3 layers in. Then a piece of tulle fabric is draped across the initial layers. When resuming the print, the new layers on top will fuse into the lower ones, securing each part to the fabric.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/11ebc0f62fdf823de19fba2dc7ab4336_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Showcase of some cosplay parts printed onto fabric.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@UncleJessy" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@UncleJessy" target="_self">Uncle Jessy</a>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The flexibility of the resulting design can be finely controlled by the geometry of the solid 3d-printed shapes.

Suddenly, the consideration is no longer about increased manufacturing cost, the only remaining factor is the time it takes to design such shapes.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Of course, complex shapes should still follow the basic constraints of the process — avoiding overhangs and not mandating support material. But beyond that, there is no reason to limit designs to the straight and rectangular shapes of traditional functional parts.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There are even places where complex, maybe organic, shapes have a use beyond appearance: For ergonomic design, such shapes are usually much better suited.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Shadow Lines" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Shadow_Lines_0">Shadow Lines</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One trick we can borrow from traditional product design practices are <em>shadow lines</em>. They improve the appearance of seams between mating surfaces of multiple joined parts. When two surfaces are pressed directly against each other, the result will never look great due to the imperfections on both sides leading to an uneven seam.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Shadow lines</em> improve on this by leaving a controlled larger gap between the surfaces and hiding the actual mechanical connection behind a small lip. The larger gap is wide enough such that the small surface imperfections are no longer distinguishable. This leaves the result with a very even look without requiring extreme precision.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/0c5999239433984382cde28a6665ec93_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The upper and lower half of the valve actuator body have an evenly sized gap between them. The real seam is actually hidden behind the shadow line.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It may be enough to place a single lip on the shadow line to hide the real seam. If dust protection is of concern, a second lip on the inner side can transform the shadow line into a sort of labyrinth seal, providing for more than just aesthetics.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Shadow lines can also be used on parts joined at an angle, like a lid placed flat onto a box. In this case, a constant offset is left between the size of the lid and the surrounding box, with alignment tabs on the inside ensuring the lid stays centered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/4c7551ec6a5952de621069e88d57b09d_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The lid is surrounded by yet another evenly sized gap. To ensure it stays centered, alignment ribs on the inside locate it quite precisely.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To learn even more about this concept, Teaching Tech has made a video about the topic (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/8dhFhU7Nl_0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://youtu.be/8dhFhU7Nl_0" target="_self">YouTube</a>).</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Surface Texture" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Surface_Texture_0">Surface Texture</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another significant factor for appearance is surface texture. With 3d-printing, we generally do not have much control about them. Especially vertical surfaces will always prominently display the layer lines inherent to the process.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With special print beds, like textured steel sheets, the bottom surface of parts can be refined. This allows for a very clean texture, but is of course quite limited because only one surface of each part can get this treatment. Sometimes, it is actually desirable to avoid having a bed surface on a part, to keep all sides looking more even. One way to do this is rotating parts to a diagonal angle relative to the print bed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For vertical surfaces, where the layer lines are sometimes destroying the aesthetics of a part, a trick has been developed to help hiding them. <em>Fuzzy skin</em> adds irregularities to each layer perimeter, building up to a surface that appears more rough, but without prominent layer lines.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fuzzy skin also has a pleasant feel to it, if tuned correctly, which has made it a popular choice for 3d-printed grips and handles.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_md5.jpg" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_MD5.jpg" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/147026254963f732cd662fc4f9058f2d_md5.jpg" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fuzzy skin on a tool grip makes for a nice appearance and pleasant feeling while holding.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Image by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fuzzy-skin_246186" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fuzzy-skin_246186" target="_self">Prusa Research</a></p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="Printed Text" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Printed_Text_0">Printed Text</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another nice side-effect of the nature of 3d-printing is the fact that it is laughably simple to add text or symbols to a part. No need for stickers, decals, or labor-intensive engravings. There is no excuse to not add text to a printed part.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A starting point is to make it a habit to add part numbers into each part of a larger design. This way it is easy to keep everything organized.

This is especially true as the font size gets smaller.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Regarding orientation, the best results will be achieved by placing the text such that it is vertical to the print surface. This way it gets printed as part of the perimeter lines where the printer can achieve the most detail.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Experience has shown that most printers can print a text with 0.6&nbsp;mm minimum stroke width and engraved to 0.5&nbsp;mm depth without issues.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="7. Extra: Vase Mode Design" dir="auto" class="heading" id="7._Extra_Vase_Mode_Design_0">7. Extra: Vase Mode Design</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For the final chapter, I want to investigate a completely different design approach for 3d-printing — vase mode design. Inherently, the FFF 3d-printing process is not volumetric. Volumetric parts are only achieved by using lines of plastic, fused together such that a volume emerges. But whether this is the most efficient way to make use of the 3d-printing process is a question worth asking.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Vase mode is an alternative approach where only a hollow shell of a part is printed, using a single perimeter line. Instead of individual layers, the Z height slowly increases such that filament is laid down in a spiral. This has a number of advantageous consequences:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">It is very efficient because 100% of the print time is spent extruding filament.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">Due to the lack of individual layers, there is no seam in the surface.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">As the printer never stops printing, no stringing issues can occur.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">It is very fast because the least amount of plastic is used to represent a part's shape.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">It can also leads to very light parts due to the decreased filament usage.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The big downside is of course that parts become very unstable due to the missing internal support. For certain kinds of parts, especially artistic ones, this may not be a problem. Even for functional parts, like vases — where this technique got its name — the strength might already be sufficient.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_md5.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded" target="_self"><img alt="_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_MD5.png" src="projects/school-25-26/engineering/_resources/design-for-3d-printing/99b57127e4d4281185efa9c0e68a0c0a_md5.png" target="_self"></span></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Vase design by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.printables.com/model/866587-sculptural-vase-vase-mode" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.printables.com/model/866587-sculptural-vase-vase-mode" target="_self">@Slimprint</a></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With vase mode, the most important factor to part strength is surface geometry.
